So, every day?
Every day, is not always like that. Like not always every day ‘ah’ because my wife, wife sometimes  ""…
OK so he said, the next day he, touch her again, hug her. ‘Ah’, ‘uh’ touch her, hug her, then he keep doing it, but it’s not every day.
‘ah’.
Not necessarily every day.
‘Ah’. .
Because my wife sleeps late.

And sometimes she doesn’t sleep until morning.
‘Ya’.
So, OK.
‘Mm’. So when you say you touch her, ‘ah’ how do you touch her?

…as shown. ‘Ah’, and, hug her.
‘Ah’. Hug her.
So, was this also at the block 148 house?
‘Ya’, 148 house.
Other than touching her, chest and, hugging her, did you touch Farhanah at any other places, of her body?
Other part don’t have. Only touch the this one and the private part only.
OK.
No other, no other, no other place.
OK. How did you touch her private part?
?
‘ah’. .
Touch.
Rub, rub.
Hold.
Rub, rub. ‘Ah’ like…
Hold and then, ‘ah’, rub against her vagina.
‘Ah’.
OK. ‘Uh’, was she and…
Were you and were she wearing any clothes? During the rubbing.
‘Ya’ I got, wearing wearing clothes.
OK.
Her?
.
She also…
.
She was also…
.
…fully clothed. Clothed.
‘Ah’. .
We were not naked.
‘Ah’.
So how do you rub her, ‘uh’ vagina area, for example was it, over her clothes or, was it under her clothes?
.
So I…
.
…put my hand inside her underwear.
‘Ya’.
Her underwear?
‘Ya’, her underwear.
Her underwear. OK.
So to clarify, am I right to say that your skin, ‘uh’, come into contact with her skin?
So, .
I, I…
When went inside, skin to skin ‘la’? Touch skin to skin?
My hand’s skin…
‘Ah’ your hand’s skin touched her, skin ‘ah’?
‘Ah’.  "".
Yes. Skin to skin.
Was she wearing any underwear?
‘Ya’. Wearing underwear.

She, never, don’t wear underwear. She always wears her underwear.
‘Ah’.
OK.
Did this touching of the vagina happen during the first incident as well?
.
.
OK.
.
OK.
.
So the first incident I did not touch her vagina.
"".
I only touch her, chest area, and her, and hugged her.
.
So since the first incident ‘ah’, I got ‘uh’, tempted by Satan, and I continued, and I ‘uh’… touched her even further ‘la’. Touch her more, in subsequent, ‘ah’ incidents.
‘Ya’.
How did Farhanah react to, you touching her?
She quiet only ‘ah’.
Even, when you touch her vagina she also keep quiet?
‘Ya’, keep quiet only.
How was the circumstances like when, she touch her during such incidence. Meaning to say, does… OK maybe we start with, did it happen during the day time or the night time?
So ?
.
At night.
‘Ah’ night.
The one, the second time?
‘Ah’, the second time is night.
The first just now, night? First was during day time.
‘Ah’.
The second and subsequent, incidence all…
Night ‘ah’.

How did it happen then?
.
.
When my wife is already asleep.
What about the other people in the house?
?
.
‘Mm’.
.
‘Mm’.
.
‘Mm’.
.
OK so in the house, wife, ‘ah’ himself, Faris, ‘ah’ Farhanah…
Fazira.
And Fazira. So when you touch, when you did this to Farhanah, the others?
.
So when I was touching Farhanah, the others are all asleep.
‘Ya’.
Which part of the house did it happen?
? When?
‘ah’.
?
.
In the room.
In the, in the bedroom.
In the bedroom.
So, based on this sleeping arrangement, how did, you, ‘uh’ manage to touch, Farhanah?
So, ‘uh’, .
‘eh’. .
‘Oh’ I would get up and go to her side, go to, her side of the bed.
Was she awake or was she asleep, when you do that to her?
?
.
I’m not sure whether she was awake, if she’s… not sure whether she’s awake or she’s asleep.
‘Ah’.
How many times did you do this to her?  "". 1 time?
Around 1 time.
Just now you mention every alternate days you will go…
.
.
?
.
‘Oh’, ‘ah’ he said…
.
So, he said when the 2 sisters are, no longer around, because they keep following their boyfriends.
‘Ah’.
Hardly came, come back home. So, the rest will sleep on the floor.
‘Ya’.
All of them will sleep on the floor.
‘Ah’.
Without the 2 sisters.
‘Ya’.
OK.
How come… I’m trying to understand because you said, that was the only time that you do to Farhanah, but earlier you said that, you did this to her every, alternate day…
Other day.
…every other day.
‘Ya’.
So, ‘uhm’, why is there a difference?
So, .
.
So ? At night, I will do that…
.
So, , ‘oh’ so, they say in 1 row…
‘Ah’ 1 row.
So, I, sleep, ‘ah’, I will sleep… who sleeps at the side, you first, and then your wife next to you ‘eh’?
.
‘Oh’, so my wife would be on the, on the, nearest, on the edge of the bed, then me, then, Farhanah?
Farhanah.
Farhanah beside you ‘la’, beside you.
‘Ah’.
Then Faris ‘eh’?
‘Ah’. No, Fazira.
Fazira.
‘Ya’.
‘Ah’. So 4 of them, in a row. So the wife, himself, Farhanah and Fazira.
‘Ya’.
That was when you, your family has gotten a bed, am I right?
?
That time also, haven’t gotten a bed.
‘Oh’ even when, no bed, on the floor.
‘Ah’ on the floor.
That is how you sleep also? So, on the floor they would sleep that way.
‘Ah’, like that also.
‘Oh’.
So you said, that was the only time that you, touch Farhanah?
‘Ya’. That’s the… that’s the only time ‘ah’, 1 time…
1 time.
‘Ya’.
So just now…
So during the day.
.
‘eh’?  ‘eh’ this?
‘Ah’ .
The first ‘eh’?
.
This is, what, 6… 6 o’clock in the morning or what?
‘Ah’ 6 in the morning.
Is this the first incident?
This is the second, incident…
‘Oh’.
…where he moved over.
‘Oh’, so this, this is the second incident ‘eh’? Or the first incident?
.
OK. So this is the second incident. So he said…
…it happened ‘ah’ when it was going to be 6 or 7 am.
OK. So, to clarify, earlier you said that something happened every other day, what do you mean by that?
OK. So when you said, you didn’t do it every day, OK, with Farhanah. You hug or what not, whatever you do, with her, so ‘ah’ you said, every day, sometimes once every 2 days.
‘Ya’.
Not every day, but once every 2 days.
‘Ya’.
Correct or not? Meaning once every 2 days.
Every 2 days ‘ya’.
‘Ah’. So, what do you mean? ‘Ah’, meaning like how ‘ah’, so how did you do it?
.
OK so he said, ‘ah’ every other day, or alternate days, when he does it to Farhanah, it, it is when his wife is, asleep. And it happen, usually happens at night.
‘Ah’.
Understand. So for every other day, ‘ah’, what kind of things did you do to Farhanah?
So, ?
Like that only.
This every other day.
Like that, like usual ‘ah’.
Meaning?
Every day like that ‘ah’. .
I would hug her.
.
Kiss her.
.
Touch her.
‘Ah’.
Rub her.
Like that ‘ah’. I didn’t rape ‘ah’.
‘Ah’, who rape?
I didn’t rape her.
‘Oh’ never rape.
‘Ah’, never.
‘Oh’ OK. So I would that, but I never rape her.
So to clarify, ‘uh’ does it mean that you would the same thing as the second incident, to Farhanah, for every other day?
So,  ‘uh’, .
.
.
. Yes, the same.
Meaning to say, you would hug her, kiss her, touch her chest area, and rub her vagina skin on skin. Is that right?
So . So, those every other days, is it the same also that you did to her Farhanah?
.
. Yes, the same.
OK, 1 thing to clarify, when you rub, her chest, was it over her clothes, or under her clothes?
‘Ah’, over the clothes.
Over outside her clothes? Not…
.
But I, I did put, slip my hand inside her, clothes. Most of the time or, all of them? All of them are like that or, some you did, some you did not? I mean, slipping your hands in.
.
OK. So not all the time, my hand goes into her…
‘Ah’ not always.
…clothes. To rub her chests.
‘Ya’.
Was Farhanah wearing her bra, at that time?
.
‘Ah’, .
Not yet, that time.
So which means to say, ‘uh’ when at that times where, you put your hand into, her shirt, you rub her chest, skin on skin, am I right to say that?
.
.
Yes.
Other than the things that you told us just now, ‘uh’, did you do anything else to Farhanah at block 148?
.
.
No. That’s all. That’s all that I did to her almost every day.
Anything else?
Has Farhanah ever confronted you before, during that time, about what were you doing to her?
Farhanah .
.
No, never. She was always keeping quiet about it.
Did anyone else, see, saw what happen?
.
.
.
‘Ah’, .
?
.
So there was 1 time, my wife wake up out of a sudden, and she saw me hugging Farhanah, and I immediately stop whatever I was doing.
Did your wife talk to you about this?
?
.
Yes.
.
She ask me, what I do, to her daughter.
.
So I just replied to her that I, that I just hug her daughter.
So this was still at block 148, is that right?
Anything else that your wife said?
No, no.
So, did your wife suspect anything?
Suspect… was never naked.
.
.
.
.
Maybe she did, suspect.
‘Ya’. Suspect ‘ah’. .
And I apologized to my wife.
What did you apologize for?
.
.
‘Oh’, so you got apologize to her, you said…
…you apologize because you her hugged and rub her daughter?
‘Ah’.
You said like that to her ‘eh’?
‘Ah’ but she didn’t, actually she didn’t know what happened.
.
OK, So I did apologised to her and told her I’m sorry that I hugged and touched…
.
…her daughter.
‘Ya’.
But actually she didn’t know that I did all those things. I just told her about it.
What ‘uh’ exactly did you tell your wife that you did?
Because I scared already.
OK but what…what did you told her?
‘Uh’ so .
‘Uh’, ‘uh’ .
. So I, I…I said sorry to her ‘uh’ for whatever I did ‘uh’ whatever happened.
.
For whatever happened and for whatever that she saw. ‘Uh’ just then. ‘Ah’.
What was her reaction to your apology?
.
.
.
.
. ‘Oh’ she was angry.
.
L…she acted like she cannot accept me.
‘Ah’.
So this was still at block 148?
‘Ya’.
OK. So after this, ‘uh’ do you continue to do the same thing to Farhana?
.
.
I continued doing.
Continue .
I…I did continue to…
.
…but I can’t remember what else I did to Farhana after that.
OK so, let’s move on to the next house that you stay in which is Block 5, Lorong 7 Toa Payoh. Did you do anything to Farhana at this house?
No. Never, long time.
Why not? ‘Uh’ why did you stop when you go over to Block 5?
… I never do anything.
.
.
‘Uh’ I never do anything. I didn’t even think of having sex with her.
When you moved out of Block 148 ‘ah’, ‘uh’ how old was Farhana?
.
.
.
She was in Primary 6.
‘Ah’.
Primary 6. So then we move on to Block 64, which is your current house.
‘Ya’.
Did you do anything to Farhana at this block?
Never.
Never do anything? So you are saying everything happened at Block 148?
‘Ya’, mostly at 148 ‘ah’   … at 148.
OK. When you…so let’s go back to 148. When you rubbed her vagina, OK do you insert your finger into her vagina?
‘Ya’ insert.
Insert ‘ah’. OK ‘uh’ which incident did this happened?
.
.
‘Mm’, .
.
So .
.
Second, no. First no, second no. Maybe the third incident, insert finger.
Third incident. What about the subsequent incidents? Do you insert your…?
.
.
So that was 1 time. So .
.
So there was only 1 time that my finger inserted ‘uh’ that his finger inserted into her vagina.
OK. Tell me ‘uh’ help me understand how do you insert your finger into her vagina.
.
.
.
.
So I was holding or rubbing her vagina. Then?
.
Then my ‘uh’ thumb we…went inside…
‘Ya’.
…her vagina.
‘Ya’.
OK ‘uh’ because this is video recorded, if you want to demonstrate, you can do so ‘la’ ‘hor’.
OK so .
So how did you hold…how did you rubbed her vagina? To start…to start with.
I just .
OK. S…OK, was holding that way and then that gesture and my thumb went inside.
‘Ya’.
OK. So let’s start from the beginning ‘ah’, when you rubbed her vagina ‘uh’ what position were you at and what position was she at?
So .
.
She was lying down.
.
.
.
And then?
.
I was squatting beside her.
‘Ah’, ‘ah’.
And she was lying down .
.  ‘Ah’ .
She was on the floor.
.
OK so I was sitting l…like that .
.
. OK so you were sitting like that on the floor.
‘Ah’,
OK.
.
Then I rubbed her vaginal, OK. And then? .
.
. And then my thumb went inside…
‘Ah’.
…her, her vagina.
‘Ya’.
So was she lying ‘uh’ sideways or facing up?
Facing up ‘la’.
Facing up ‘ah’. So was she on the floor or on the bed?
Floor.
On the floor? OK. So when you rubbed her vagina at the time, ‘uh’ were you and was she wearing any clothes?
‘Ya’ wearing…wearing clothes.
OK. So ‘uh’ assuming that she’s lying down, OK how do you rubbed her vagina? Can you show us?
.
Ss…like that. In what? In circular motion ‘eh’?
.
OK so the 4 fingers was on top of her vagina…
‘Ah’.
…part. And then my finger…
.
…went inside
Thumb ‘uh’?
‘Uh’ sorry, ‘ya’ the thumb.
So for the purpose of this ‘uh’ interview, what you have demonstrate is that you put your 4 fingers on top. And you used your thumb to rub…
‘Ya’.
…her vagina. Is that correct?
‘Ya’, correct.
OK. And when you were rubbing, you insert your thumb into the vagina?
‘Ya’.
Is that correct?
‘Ya’, correct.
What…did   … did you purposely insert your thumb into her vagina?
.
.
I don’t know whether it was on purpose or not.
.
Things, because things just happen.
How much of your thumb went into her vagina?
.
Maybe you can lift up and show the camera?
camera?
OK.
OK.
So about 1 joint ‘ah’ of your thumb…
‘Ya’.
…went in. So how did Farhana react to this when you insert   …
Just keep quiet only ‘ah’.
Keep quiet. Did she ‘uh’ what about her body? Did she moved or…?
No move, just stand, quiet only.
OK. So other than this…
Do you recall when…when was this incident?
.
.
.
.
Can’t remember.
.
But I know that it’s at night.
How old was she?
.
.
She was ‘uh’ Primary 6, Primary 6.
When you first touched her, she was also Primary 6?
.
.
.
I think ‘uh’ she was in…
.
…Primary 5.
.
Or maybe Primary 6.
So to clarify earlier, you said that the, this…this incident was not the first incident and not the second incident.
‘Ya’.
Is that correct?
OK. ‘Uhm’ maybe we give you a piece of paper again…
…so that we can indicate the timeline of the period when you were staying at the 3 house. It would be easier for us to get a sensing ‘ah’.
OK. Mr Jason, don’t have any other paper so…
‘Orh’ then I   … it’s OK, it’s just beside.
OK ‘uh’ I will indicate the timeline, so that it’s easier for us to make some sense of it ‘la’. You mentioned that, I will help you write. 2005, you moved 148. Correct?
So , 148 ‘eh’?
‘Mm’.
The first house, .
Block 148.
Block  2005.
‘Ah’ .
Yes, correct.
.
You said you stayed at Block 148 for about 10 years.
‘Ya’.
So it should be around 2015.
Correct? You moved to…
Block 5.
…block 5.
… block 5.
Block 5…
Lorong 7, Toa Payoh.
Same ‘ah’, Toa Payoh.
‘Mm’, Toa Payoh.
After that, your current house is at block 64?
‘Ya’.

2 years later?
2 years after that ‘eh’?
2 years ‘ah’, 2 years.
Block 64, Lorong?
Lorong 5.
Lorong 5, Toa Payoh.

OK. So when…you said that when you moved out   … moved to block 5, Toa Payoh ‘uh’ Farhana was Primary 6. Correct? Just now you mention.
‘Ya’, ‘ya’ Primary 6.
She’s now maybe…we calculate a bit ‘ah’.
…
Now she’s 28 to 29 years old. When she was Primary 6, is 12.
‘Mm’.
So 16 years ago?
15, 16 years ago.
No, don’t make sense. ‘Tsk’ OK never mind, I think this is your timeline ‘uh’ we will just stick to this ‘la’. I will label this Annex B. Farhana was Primary 6. Or Secondary School? Can you remember when you moved to block 5?
.
Secondary ‘ah’. Secondary .
1?
Guanyang  Guanyang Secondary.
Guanyang Secondary School?
‘Ya’.

OK, anything else?
‘Uh’ so far,   …
‘Mm’.
OK. So other than Farhana, did you do any similar acts to your other daughters?
.
.
No.
So to be clear, did you do this to Fazira?
.
.
No.
Did you do this to Fadilah?
Fadilah, no.
Did you do this to Fatimah?
No.
OK. Why did you do this to only Farhana?
.
Because she was the one who dare…
.
…to be close to me.
.
Mean…meaning during that first…
.
…because she came close to me and lie down beside me.
‘Ah’.
And leaned against me.
‘Ah’. .
That…
.
…the other 3 daughters did not do this.
‘Ah’.
So at the start of this interview, you shared with me that ‘uh’ your Farhana ‘uh’ your relationship with Farhana was not good.
‘Ya’.
OK. So, and now you are saying that ‘uh’ when she was young, she would come close to you.
‘Ya’.
OK so when did this changed?
So .
.
‘Uh’ so and then ‘uh’ .
.
She changed when she got married to her husband.
.
And she totally changed with me.
I move on to the allegations? OK. So ‘uhm’ we received some information and ‘uh’ will now will clarify with you on what is your…what do you have to say on these things that I  "" ... OK. So was there a time where your wife Rosini was in prison?
.

‘Ya’, ‘ya’.
‘Ya’? OK can. So we received information that ‘uh’ at in 2005, when Rosini was in prison, there was a time where you put your finger into Farhana’s vagina. Then you licked her vagina and then you finger her again. What do you have to say about this?
I licked?
‘Mm’. .
.

Lick.
Then after that finger again.
‘Ah’, OK so .
.
OK, it…that could be right. Because I could have forgotten about it. I could have forgotten about it and what you…what you…you said could be right.
OK.
He said that.
In your memory, do you remember licking Farhana’s vagina?
So  Farhana.
.
No, I don’t remember.
OK. So we also have information that after this incident, there was another incident where you, in the same month, where you also insert your finger into Farhana’s vagina.
No, I just insert 1 time only. Once a time.

‘Mm’.
So they ‘uh’ they put my stuffs, my other, my remaining stuffs outside then I just took…I, I took it and I, I went to book for a Grab to go home.

OK so were you ever ‘uh’ romantically involved with her?
No.
Do you have …No? So did she ever express that she has any liking for you?
No.
So ‘uh’ so I understand there were 8 of you inside .So why did you ask only Cazaiya to go with you to this room?
Because ‘uh’ she couldn’t sleep as well. So ‘uh’ like I ask her if she wanted to go there, like as well ‘ah’.
‘Ya’, so that’s why I ask her.
So you mean…so what about the rest of the Hotel friends? Were they already sleeping?
‘Ya’, they were already sleeping. I think they were sleeping.
OK so you …OK so you ask Cazaiya to follow you is because at that point you saw that she also couldn’t sleep?
‘Ya’.
She was awake?
Correct.
So that’s why you ask her to follow you and Jeramiah to the other room to rest?
Yes.
Because you had, you had assume that I mean what, what you have observed the rest of them were already asleep ‘la’.
Correct.
That’s why you…
So that was the reason why you ask her instead.
Yes.
OK.
OK…
…when you ask her to go to the same room with you…
‘Mm hm’.
…do you have the intention to have sex with her, at that point of time?
No.
Don’t have?

So when did you have the urge?
I think it was when ‘uh’ like 3 of us were sleeping…
‘Mm’.
…then I have the sudden urged of wanting to have sex with her.
After Jeramiah left the room? Is it?
‘Uh’ it was ‘uh’ it was…
…it’s before.
When was that?
‘Uh’ it was in the middle ‘ah’ when we ‘uh’ when we, 3 of us were sleeping, ‘ya’. But I’m not too sure when but like there, the sudden urge was there.

OK. OK.
So during the condition ‘ah’, I just want to ask about her, Cazaiya condition. Was she totally drunk on that day, on that night?
I assume that she wasn’t drunk because we didn’t drink much that night, ‘ya’.
So maybe can you tell me how much did you all…based on what you can recall, how much did you drink? OK how much did you dink on that night?
‘Uh’ so we use a like the dustbin basket ‘uh’ we cleanse it and then we put ice like to make like a ‘uh’ bucket worth of drinks. But ‘uh’ to my knowledge ‘uh’ like I …many of us didn’t drink much. ‘Ah’ so for me I drank like, even though there’s like many bottles of   …like Soju right. So there’s like many different flavours.
OK wait ‘ah’.

‘Mm’. OK. So how many for you…how much alcohol do you consume?
I think because like the …like I drink from different bottles already right, so I think I, I only drink Soju. So I think I drank like a, like a 1 bottle worth of Soju. Which is not much ‘ah’.
So you say you drank …
…1 bottle of Soju?
‘Ya’.
But you say you drank from many bottle?
‘Ya’.
What do you mean?

So she was sitting next to you ‘la’, that’s why you know how much roughly she drank ‘la’?
‘Ya’.
OK. So what was her …what do you think was her state? Was she drunk when you woke her up in the night? To go to the next room.

‘Ah’… she’s left ‘lor’.
‘Ah’ left side of her…
Arm.
…arm ‘ah’ touches my right side of my arm.
‘Mm’.
OK, so…
So I tried to avoid…
‘Ya’.
…and ‘uh’ I continued chatting with my acquaintance ‘uh’…
‘Yup’.
…at the pub.
OK, so ‘uh’ I summarise ‘ah’. So, at one point…
…when you were smoking outside with your pub acquaintance, Esther came up and joined you…
…your group…
‘Mm’.
…and she lean her right side…
Should be her left.
Lean?
Lean her left side of her body against the right side of, of you, OK? And ask you ‘uh’ how you know her name?
‘Ya’.
This is correct ‘ah’?
‘Ya’.
Does Esther smoke?
Should have…like got ‘ah’.
Yes.
OK. All right, so we are clear on this, this part. We move on ‘ah’.
‘Orh’.
So when you… earlier on you mentioned, right, that you came out from the toilet, ‘uh’… no, sorry. When you were going to the toilet…
I alone.
…she approached you.
When I…
Were you coming out…
…come out.
…or going in?
I came out already.
Came out already.
OK.
Then she wanted to go in ‘la’? She wanted to go the female toilet ‘la’?
OK. All right, so ‘uh’ never mind, we clarify again ‘ah’. So when you left the, the toilet…
‘Mm’.
…you met Esther…
Yes.
…along the way?
‘Ya’.
OK. So she approached you…
‘Mm’.
…and talked to you again?
‘Ya’. Asked me ‘uh’ how I know her name, like first time saw me, how I… “You never saw me before, how come you know my name?”
‘Mm’. OK, so she asked you again how you got to know her name…
‘Mm’.
…‘uh’ and she asked you to wait for her as she’s going to the toilet. Am I correct?
‘Ya’.
So you decided to wait for her to come out from the toilet because you do not know what she wants to talk to you about.
Because she say “You wait a moment ‘ah’, I go pee first.” Then I thought she got something to tell me, right, ‘ya’.
All right. So where, where did you… where were you waiting for her?
Along the girls’ toilet, outside ‘lor’. Because boys’ toilet…
‘Mm’ ‘hm’.
…come out is girls’ toilet ‘ma’.
‘Mm’ ‘hm’.
Around… ‘eh’, I wait for her, I sit down.
‘Mm’.
Sit down on the, like… there got a steamboat.
‘Mm’ ‘hm’.
Steamboat shop ‘ma’.
‘Mm’.
Outside got those tables and chair.
‘Mm’ ‘hm’.
So I just sit down ‘lor’.
So you sat at ‘uh’ one of the tables…
‘Ah’.
…belonging to the steamboat shop…
‘Ah’.
…while you waiting for Esther to come out?
Yes.
OK, so after ‘uh’ Esther came out from the toilet…
Came out then say…
…OK, what happened after that?
I say ‘ah’ “‘Eh’, I walk there already, it’s too far already, the escalator.”
‘Mm’ ‘hm’.
Then ‘uh’… ‘eh’, sorry. Then I, ‘uh’ I, I say I want to take staircase.
‘Mm’.
‘Ya’. And…
You told her that you wanted to take the staircase…
‘Ya’.
…because escalator was too far.
‘Ah’.
And where did you want to take the staircase to?
‘Ah’ downstair ‘lor’.
Downstair…
Just walk, walk downstair then take a Grab or go Jurong East MRT.
OK, that was your plan ‘la’?
‘Ah’.
To leave the place?
Then she say “‘Eh’, I… go together ‘la’, my Grab coming already.”
All right.
So she is scared late ‘uhm’ late ‘ah’. Is it… late, correct? That is the Grab driver…
Wait too long?
‘Ah’, don’t let him wait too long, so ‘ah’ she said OK, OK, ‘uh’ we walk staircase, then we open the door, it’s all locked.
OK. So…
…can you tell us which floor were the two of you locked at?
I’m really not sure ‘leh’.
The… no, at the toilet, that one is which floor toilet? Is it the same floor as the pub?
Pub, ‘ah’ I think so ‘la’.
And at which floor is the pub located?
Second floor.
Second floor? So you…‘uh’ you all used the toilet at the second floor, right?
‘Ya’.
Then both of you went…
Went down…
…down the staircase…
‘Ya’.
…to the first floor. And ‘uh’ what happened at the first floor?
Then after that the door all locked, right?
‘Mm’.
So I messaged Ah Heng and say “‘Eh’, ‘ah’ ,‘ah’ help me, can?”
‘Mm’ ‘hm’.
To open the door but he never call me, never reply.
Ah Heng? You…
‘Ya’. He…
…text him to ask him to help open the door?
Then the Esther, I don’t know where she go because she just walked down the stairs. I don’t know how to say “walked down the stairs”.
But you said you also walked down the stairs, correct?
I took the stairs. We opened the door ‘ma’.
Correct, correct…
Upstairs, downstairs.
So you all walked down the stairs together, correct?
‘Ah’.
Then when reached downstairs, you’re saying the door was locked?
‘Ya’. Then after that I went back to the staircase on top ‘la’, I think…
‘Oh’, OK. So, so…
‘Ah’.
…the door was locked, so you went back to second floor, is it?
‘Ah’. Then I went…
What about Esther?
I don’t know. She walked downstairs.
So you yourself, so you yourself…

So I sit at the staircase…
‘Mm’ ‘hm’.
…I message Ah Heng for help.
‘Mm’. OK, we stop here first ‘ah’.
Wait a while, wait a while.

So you’re saying you went back to second floor, then you messaged Ah Heng ‘la’.
‘Ya’.
Where did you say you were sitting at?
I was sitting at the staircase. I…
‘Orh’ OK at the second floor staircase?
‘Ah’.
But what about Esther?
Esther has walked away.
‘Huh’?
Has walked away. She go and open the door.
So she’s also… The door was locked, so how did she walk away?
I don’t know.
Then…
OK, wait a while.
OK, just translate first.
‘Uh’ I realised the door at the first floor was locked so I ‘uh’ went upstairs. I went up to second floor and sit at the, sit at the staircase ‘uh’ and texted ‘uh’ Ah Heng to help to open the door. ‘Uh’ but Ah Heng did not reply.
‘Mm’.
OK.
‘Uh’…
So where is Esther?
Esther, not sure. She just go away. Then ‘uh’ I message Ah Heng like about 1 minute… I never go and count ‘la’ but just a while only ‘la’ then I heard like… The door opened already, I opened and then I walked carpark, multi-storey carpark.
So, that time, you walked back down again or…
No, I…
…because you said you were seated on the second floor.
Right, I ran up, ran down.
‘Huh’? Ran up, ran down?
‘Ah’, ran up, ran down, open the door…
OK, you take one step at a time. So you were originally seated on the second floor staircase texting Ah Heng. Ah Heng did not reply. After that?
I don’t know which floor ‘la’. It’s around the Bistro outside the staircase that I ran up, ran down.
‘Ya’, but you ran up, ran down, did you run to other floors, or just the first and second floors?
I don’t know. I just up down, up down, like that. I also did not look if it’s second floor, third floor ‘ma’.
OK. ‘Ah’ maybe I, I summarise step-by-step.
He will summarise what you said just now, then you see if it is correct, if it is what you meant.
‘Ya’, then, then, then ‘uh’ let him correct, correct me ‘la’. OK, so ‘uh’ you, you interpret to, to him ‘ah’. OK, so you and Esther entered the staircase…
‘Mm’.
…and walk down to the ground level.
So, first of all, it’s you and Esther together at the staircase walk down from the second floor to the first floor.
‘Mm’.
Correct?
Then you… both of you realised that the door at the ground level was locked.
Then when walked to the first floor, discovered that the door at the first floor was locked.
Yes.
Correct?
So you walked up to the second level.
Then you walked back to second floor.
And text  …
Walked up ‘ah’.
And texted Ah Heng.

Then you sent a message to Ah Heng.
Asking Ah Heng to help open the door ‘la’.
Ask, ask Ah Heng ‘uh’ to help…
…
…to open the door.
But he did not reply.
But he did not reply.
OK, and at that time, you do not know where Esther was.
Then at that time…
I saw her go down. Then I say “‘Eh’, wait, I message Ah Heng for help.”
‘Mm’ ‘hm’. OK, at this point ‘ah’, I stop you ‘ah’. So you were at the second floor, Esther supposedly was at the first floor. So how she go down further?
I never saw. I don’t know.
You don’t know?
‘Ya’.
So, is it…
…correct to say that you… when you were at the second floor and messaging Ah Heng…
She…
…you do not know where Esther was?
‘Ya’, I don’t know.
OK.
She just go away because maybe she was rushing.
‘Mm’ ‘hm’.
Because she tell me ‘uh’ her Grab is coming soon.

So…

…I open the door…
‘Mm’ ‘hm’.

Correct.
‘Ah’ after that?

‘Mm’.
There’s door.
OK. Can the door on the second floor open? You went up…
I heard… I heard a sound. I opened, it’s already opened.
OK. All right…
Are you referring to the door on the second floor?
I don’t know which floor. I didn’t see. I ran up, ran down. I also did not see which level, ‘ya’.
OK. So ‘uh’ never mind. I… I’ll summarise for him, then you translate.
He will summarise, then you see if it is correct.
OK, so…
…you were at the second floor when you texted Ah Heng, correct?
On the second floor, you sent a message to Ah Heng.
Ah Heng did not reply.
He did not reply ‘ah’.
OK. So you went up and down.
‘Ah’ try to open again…
Try to open the doors to the staircase.
‘Ya’, I’m alone.
You were alone at that point of time?
‘Ya’.
OK. And at one point, you realised the door can be opened.
‘Ya’.
So you walked out?
I walked out, is not bistro.
‘Ya’.
Is a multi-storey carpark.
It was a multi-storey carpark ‘ah’? OK.
So I just walk multi-storey carpark, and I go down.
OK. So ‘uh’ you cannot recall at which floor…
I…
…you managed to find a door that can open.
‘Ya’.
But when you opened it, you walked out, it was a multi-storey carpark.
Multi-storey carpark, ‘ya’.
So you took the driveway down…
‘Mm’ ‘hm’.
…‘uh’ from the multi-storey carpark to where? Ground floor?
‘Ya’, ground floor. Then I walk to MRT station.
OK. Then you walked towards the MRT station?

Not, not got a fright, it’s shocked. Like, ask me this… ask me this thing, then I like shocked ‘la’, I say what thing? I’m alone, I don’t know anything ‘lor’. Then he say “You anyhow go and touch my waitress.” I say “When did I go and touch your waitress when I’m alone ‘leh’?” ‘Ya’, then we lock at the staircase, right, I ask you open the door, help, help me open the door. Esther is already gone.”
‘Mm’.

Also drinks there at the bistro, is it?
‘Ah’ a customer.
OK. ‘Uh’…
But…
…so what you said just now about there was body contact, also didn’t say what…
Because I…
…who said that? Who? Lizhen or Jess?
All of them said “You, you, you also will not, say, go and touch us ‘ma’.
‘Ah’ “All of them”, you’re saying includes Lizhen and Jess ‘la’?
‘Ya’ ‘ah’.
OK, good.
And Alexi.
‘Uh’ ‘uh’…

And Alexi.

‘Mm’.
But ‘ah’…
…not work every time.
‘Ah’ Part-time ‘la’, sometimes will come, sometimes will not come that kind ‘la’, correct? OK.
OK, I summarise ‘ah’. All right, so you texted a few friends…
No, we chat on the phone.
Who? You chat with who first?
‘Ah’ with Lizhen, Alexi, Jess, Ah Boon.
‘Oh’, so you call many people at that point of time?
‘Ah’.

…So they also got tell me ‘la’.
‘Mm’.
‘Ah’ why Esther go and follow you take Grab? Now got problem already.
‘Mm’. OK, stop here at that ‘ah’. All right, ‘ah’ so I’ll do a summary and ‘ah’ you listen carefully.
‘Mm’.
And correct me if I‘m wrong.
OK.
OK? If you don’t understand, ‘uh’ Mr Vincent will be… is here to help ‘ah’.
OK.
All right. So, after talking to Ah Heng, by then some of the friends, or some of the people that you know at the pub ‘ah’…
‘Mm’ and waitress.
…and waitress already got to know that ‘uh’ you have some problem with Esther, correct?
No, some waitress don’t know.
‘Mm’ ‘hm’.
I tell them ‘la’.
OK. All right, so you spoke to some of them ‘la’, OK they are Lizhen, Jess and Alexis.
‘Mm’.
Lizhen and Alexis are working at the pub.
‘Ya’.
Jess is…
A customer.
…a friend of one of the pub customer.
But she, she got work DNA for few days or one week also.
‘Oh’ OK. So Jess was…
‘Ah’.
…previously ‘uh’ one of the waitress.
But actually she’s a regular customer.
And she is a regular customer. OK, so generally the conversation you had with the 3 of them, they were saying that you are not that type of person.
‘Ya’.
Correct? And ‘uh’ they remember you as someone who will not go touchy…
‘Mm’, is not.
…with them.
Even though smoke ‘ah’, like 2 person go smoke or…
‘Mm’.
…what, I also will, like, quiet ‘la’, like, like the waitress will sit beside me, I will be ‘diam diam’ sit there, smoke and chit chat only. Like, I won’t touch hand touch leg with them or anything. ‘Ya’.
Because even if ‘uh’ only 2 of us smoking there, ‘uh’ only 2 person, 2 of us smoking there, I, I will just smoke quietly or even I’ll, I will just chit chat ‘uh’ but will not…
‘Ya’.
…‘uh’…
Is at the… is at the overhead bridge there…
‘Mm’.
…quite quiet too.
I will not anyhow touch the girls.
OK. All right, so in, in general, ‘uh’ you’re saying that you’re a person of good character ‘la’, you will not do any…
‘Ya’.
…nonsense ‘uh’ to the girls, correct?
‘Ya’.
OK, so, so after that ‘uh’ who else you spoke to and…
‘Ah’ Mervyn. Mer, Mervyn is my ‘ah’ secondary friend. We from around… because I retain primary school for 2 years.
‘Mm’ ‘hm’.
So I know Mervyn when I was secondary 2 and Mervyn is 13 years old, sec 1.
‘Mm’.
‘Ya’, when I’m…
…‘ah’ sec 2, I already 16 because primary school I retain for 2 years, so I know Mervyn more than 15, 16 years. So..
‘Mm’ ‘hm’.
…he got message Ah Heng.
‘Mm’ ‘hm’.
He say “You trust me ‘la’. Ah Keong ‘ah’, I know him so long already, so many years.”
‘Mm’ ‘hm’.
“He is not that type of, of person ‘la’.” ‘Ya’, he even know my phone number, the screenshot and the video.
‘Mm’ ‘hm’.
Mervyn go and message Ah Heng. ‘Ya’.
So…
…Mervyn who is a old friend of yours ‘uh’ also texted Ah Heng to vouch for you. You understand what is the meaning of “vouch” or not?
That is to say he helped to speak up for me.
Correct. That is to say he said you… he, he, he personally also felt that you cannot possibly be that type of person ‘la’.
‘Mm’.
You won’t behave in that manner, won’t do such a thing.
‘Ya’, so Mer, Mervyn vouched for you to Ah Heng that you are not that type of person ‘la’.
‘Ya’. Then Mervyn still got send Ah Heng message “If Ah Keong want to touch this waitress, all your previous waitress already ‘kena’.”
OK. ‘Kena’ means ‘uh’ also got touched already ‘la’? Is that what you’re trying to say?
That is to say ‘agak agak’ ‘la’.
That is to say if you want to ‘uh’…
…lay your hand on the waitress…
Correct.
That is to say, be this kind of person…
The others already…
…acted in that manner…
‘Ah’.
…previously would have done the same to other waitresses.
Correct. But until now, there is no waitress complained about me, like…
‘Mm’.
…yesterday was very…
‘Mm’. OK, so to summarise ‘ah’ OK, correct me if I’m wrong, so what you’re trying to say was Mervyn was speaking up for you by telling Ah Heng that if you have wanted to do something like this to Esther…
Correct.
…you would have already done the same to…
‘Ya’.
…all his other waitresses ‘la’. So in summary, Mervyn was telling Ah Heng that you’re not the type that will do this kind of thing and ‘uh’ that he knows you for such a long time already.
‘Mm’.
OK. This is correct ‘ah’?
‘Mm’.
OK, so after you reached home, ‘uh’ did anything out of ordinary happen?
I sit at my house downstair. ‘Ah’… my brain is in a mess that a thing like this happened, like, Ah Heng tell me Esther report police, then didn’t do anything, why want to harm me?
‘Uh’ I, when I reached home, I sat downstairs and I was very confused.
Stressed ‘ah’.
Stressed. ‘Uh’ you said because Ah Heng told you ‘uh’…
So I…
Esther lodged a police report, is it?
‘Ah’.
OK. Because Ah Heng told me Esther had report… made police report, so I was thinking I did not do anything, why she want to prey me.
‘Ah’. Then, then just because of her staircase only, right, then I got tell Mervyn ‘lor’ there was nothing, no camera, like, the girl ‘huh’ no matter what will always right, we guys will definitely lose.
Who did you say to?
Mervyn they all.
And I also told Mervyn ‘uh’ there was no camera and whatever the girl say will ‘uh’ ‘uhm’ it will…
Will definitely lose to them ‘ma’.
‘Mm’. ‘Uh’ will be more believable.
‘Huh’?
You said what the girl said people will tend to believe, right?
‘Mm’.
Then you all… what then?
Then Mervyn ‘ah’ say “Never mind ‘la’, I ‘uh’ I now will message Ah Heng ‘la’, tell him more about you ‘la’.” That is, to let him understand, understand more ‘ah’.
I, I… ‘uhm’ Mervyn then said never mind ‘ah’, he would message Ah Heng to tell him more of…
He will understand.
…your characters.
‘Ah’.
Tell me… tell him more about me.
Ah Keong, ‘ah’.
‘Mm’. OK, so to summarise ‘ah’…
…when you arrive back at the house… your, your house there, you sat at the void deck. You were feeling very confused and stressed.
‘Ya’.
Then ‘uh’ you were still talking to Mervyn.
Mervyn, Ah Boon, Jess, Alexi, Lizhen.
‘Mm’. OK, all through phone call or messagings?
Some message, some call.
‘Mm’ ‘hm’. All right, so you were talking to quite a number of people at the same time ‘la’.
‘Ya’, because I  …
‘Uh’ by voice call and messages ‘huh’?
‘Mm’.
Correct? ‘Uh’ sorry. So in particular ‘ah’, towards Mervyn, you told him that there was no camera at the staircase and this is not to your advantage because people will tend to believe what the girl said.
Correct, ‘ya’.
That is correct? You understand what I’ve just said, right?
‘Ah’, understand ‘ah’?
‘Mm’, understand.
OK, then Mervyn told you that OK, ‘ah’ he will contact Ah Heng and let Ah Heng understand your character more.
‘Ya’.
OK.
So after that, Mervyn got send me video of the message ‘la’.
‘Mm’.
‘Ya’. What he tell Ah Heng ‘la’.
Mervyn sent you a video…
Screenshot.
…screenshot of ‘uh’ what he told Ah Heng about you.
‘Ya’.
OK. And ‘uh’ so after that, what happened?
After that ‘ah’ I talk to my  … he’s a new friend from the top ‘la’.

‘Mm’. So you spoke to a few people. Then after that you went back home?
And Lizhen… no, I stay at downstairs.
‘Mm’.

OK. All right, so that was all that happened yesterday ‘la’ until this morning.
All right, so…

You, you bring me?
‘Uh’ no, I mean ‘uh’…
‘Orh’ ‘orh’…
‘Uh verbally I, I’m bringing you…
Want to…
…back to that portion ‘la’. So, when you waited for Esther outside the toilet and she came out from the toilet, you told me earlier that you wanted to take a staircase down, right, and Esther followed you.
You mean after we both…
That is to say because you, you came out of the toilet and ran into her. She said she was going to the toilet.
She said she wanted to pee. Then I…
‘Mm’.
Then you said you sat at the chair, then she went to the toilet. Then she came out, correct?

After coming out, what then?
Then she walked past me, I told her I want to take the staircase. Then she said she book Grab, then she followed me ‘la’. I said I don’t want to take escalator.
‘Mm’. OK, ‘uh’ we have cleared that part earlier on.

…to the staircase, that is before the 2 of you realised that the door cannot open. When you all going to the staircase.
She also got walk in front because she want to open door. She scared the Grab is coming ‘ma’, reached already or what. So that’s why…
So at the level 2 ‘ah’…
‘Ah’.
…sorry ‘ah’, at the level 2 ‘uh’ when you all are going to take the staircase down, she was walking in front because…
‘Ya’, she was also trying…
…she was…she wanted to open the door?
‘Ya’, she want to open also.
So she was the one who open the door to the second floor staircase?
I’m not sure which floor ‘la’.
No, no, no. I’m still…
He is talking…
…talking about the, the… I’m still talking about when both of you wanted to take the staircase.
Because you were initially on the second floor, so to go down…
‘Oh’ we want to go down, we want to open the door…
Hold on. When you are going down, on the second floor, when you want to go down the stairs, do you have to open the door first?
‘Ah’.
So during that time when you walk to the…
Walk to the staircase to go down?
…staircase to go down, was Esther walking beside you, in front of you or behind you?
In front ‘la’.
She was in front of you?
Because walk together ‘la’.
‘Ya’, but was she in front of or beside you?
But was she in front or…
Like in front ‘leh’ because she ran… she also ran to open the door. In, in front ‘la’.
So when want to go down the stairs, was she the one who opened the door?
‘Ah’.
She was the one who opened the door?
‘Ah’. Like I…
When wanting to go down from the second floor?
‘Ya’.
She opened the door?
That one, she walked in front of me. She opened the door and said locked. Then I…
No, no, no, hold on. Now, haven’t walked down the stairs, how to lock? Now, you all… he is asking you…
The door was opened by me.
OK, so on the second floor to go down the stairs, you opened the door ‘la’?
‘Ah’, I opened.
Then after you opened, did you let her go down first or…?
‘Ah’.
Is it?
Correct. Then after that, started to walk…
So she was walking… that means to say…
‘Ah’.
…when going down the stairs, she was walking in front of you ‘la’?
Correct. She opened the door.
So she walked in front of you to the first floor, she opened the door.
‘Mm’.
OK, hang on ‘ah’, sorry ‘ah’. This one getting very messy ‘ah’.
‘Ah’.
Alright. So I, I just want to be very clear. When you and Esther were still at the second floor.
At the toilet there.
‘Ah’ toilet there. Both of you all walked towards the staircase.
‘Mm’.
Correct? So when both of you all were walking towards the staircase…
‘Ya’.
…where was Esther? Was she walking in front of you? She was walking first…
‘Ya’.
…or walking behind you? Or walking beside you?
Just beside a little.
Just slightly beside you?
‘Ah’ I open the door and then she stand beside me, she walk out.
OK.
‘Ya’.
So were you all holding hands or anything?
No ‘la’. Hold hand for what?
OK. So that means she was walking slightly ‘uh’ diagonal to your front.
Diagonal?
That is to say is a little slanted at an angle, then she… you opened the door, you pulled open…
Correct, she…
Second floor, you pulled open the door first, then she first…
…let her go down the stairs first, correct?
Correct, ‘ah’ ‘ya’.
So at that time, you all did not open it very big, so she needs to…
‘Uh’ correct.
…go sideways, go sideways to go downstairs ‘la’.
Correct.
OK.
OK, so I, I, I will do a summary of what has just said ‘huh’, so as to be clear. All right, ‘uh’ both of you correct me if I’m wrong ‘ah’.
‘Mm’.
So, at the second floor, after she came out from the toilet, OK, both of you all walked towards the staircase.
‘Mm’.
OK, she was walking slightly in front and diagonal of you. So when you reach the door…
‘Ah’…
When walking, walking together towards the second floor… to open the door to go down, were you walking in front, pulled open the door, she… the door… she had to move sideways in order to pass through the door to go down the stairs ‘la’? But when walking together, actually both of you were walking together like that, correct?
‘Ah’.
Is that right?
‘Ya’, I, I… this part I can understand.
‘Ah’ OK, OK.
So you, so you understand ‘hor’?
Understand.
Stop me if you don’t understand.
‘Ya’.
So she was slightly in front of you, that means she was leading the way. Then reaching the door, you open the door…
‘Mm’.
…to let her go through, like gentleman…
‘Ya’.
…gesture. You, you hold the door open for her, she enter.
‘Ya’.
All right, then there was another door or there wasn’t any other door?
There shouldn’t be ‘la’. ‘Ah’ I don’t think got another door.
Don’t think there’s another door ‘ah’? So that was when both of you walked down to the ground floor and realised that the door was…
Locked.
…locked ‘la’.
‘Ya’, she go and open the door, and then it’s locked.
OK. ‘Mm’. So she tried to open the door and told you that it’s locked?
Then we panicked ‘ah’ ‘gan chiong’ ‘ah’.
‘Ah’ so…
So…
…both of you panicked?
I thought ‘wa’ locked ‘ah’, cannot go out.
‘Mm’.
So run up and down. She go open, I go open, ‘mm’.
All right, so this part ‘ah’, earlier on you said that you went up to the second floor, all right. Then ‘ah’ you don’t know where she was, she probably was still on the first floor.
No, I open the door…
You’re saying that, now you’re saying that both of you all going up and down.
‘Ya’ we ran up, ran down to open.
‘Mm’.
Then maybe she tired or what ‘la’, I don’t know ‘la’. Then I say I… never mind, I text Ah Heng for help.
‘Mm’ ‘hm’.
Then she just walk go down.
OK. All right, so…
‘Ya’.
So, we…
Maybe she don’t want to up and down already.
‘Orh’ OK. So we, we just clarify on this, this portion ‘ah’. So ‘uh’ both of you all at the ground floor realise… she go and open the door, realise that it was locked. Then both of you panicked.
Both also locked.
You all start to go up and down…
‘Ah’ I also  …
…checking out the doors and see which one can open.
‘Ya’.
At one point ‘uh’ you told her that never mind…
I text Ah Heng…
…you will text Ah Heng to open…
…for help.
…‘ah’ for help. OK, and after a while you saw her walk…
‘Mm’.
…downwards and you didn’t see her anymore.
‘Ya’.
OK, and that was the point whereby you found a door that opens out to the… leading to the multi-storey carpark?
Correct, correct, ‘ya’.
OK, and ‘uh’ just now you also clarify that there was no body contact, you also did not hold her hand or, or, or what when the two of you all were walking towards the staircase at level 2, right? OK, can. So…
‘Ah’ touched a little, never mind. I got the number ‘ah’, not anything. I hold the phone number like that, help her press, press, press. Touched a little, it’s OK, right?
‘Mm’…
Because like…
You… hold on.
Hold on ‘ah’.
You said press, press, press number. Why press number?
At… she wanted my number.
‘Ah’? Was it at the elevator… when going down the stairs?
No. At the toilet there.
No, no. He’s now talking about…
‘Orh’ OK, OK.
…when you all have already walked down the stairs, then ran up, ran down, correct.
No, so… I understand but I…
‘Ah’.
…want to ask like that touched the hand, because for example…
So you, you, you, you listen properly. He’s now asking… you…
I, I know.
…have already asked for the number.
‘Mm’, OK.
You have already asked for the phone number. It’s just at that point of time, from the second floor, she came out from the toilet…
This one I…
…to go downstairs and upstairs. Matters that pertain to this time.
Correct, this one I understand.
OK.
Do you get it? I understand.
I do, so…
Hang on, hang on.
You listen for a while. He is not asking you about the time when you asked for the phone number.
I know.
‘Ah’ then?
I am asking, I’m just asking…
‘Mm’ ‘mm’.
OK, OK.
You understand or not?
‘Mm’ ‘Mm’.
‘Uh’…
Oh my, you are making it worse.
All right, cool down, cool down. Never mind, never mind, it’s OK.
‘Wa’…
All right, never mind
Make it more…
I, I, I will summarise…
Why did you ask such a person to do translation?
‘Uh’ OK, OK, enough, all right.
OK, never mind, we, we just get this straight. You were asking me because I asked you about ‘uh’ were, were there any body contact with… between you and Esther. You were asking me what if at the point of time when she was asking you for your number…
Correct, this…
…there might be a body contact…
‘Ya’.
…‘uh’ because…she was holding on the phone…
…
…or you were holding…
She holding, then she want my number. Our hands will definitely touch or contact.
OK, so there was a, a…
I’m just asking…
‘Mm’.
I’m just asking…
‘Mm’.
…is that an offence, like that?
No, no.
Nobody is saying it’s an offence or not.
We are not talking about that.  …
He is now asking you about the time when going up…
‘Uh’ Mr Vincent…
…and down the stairs.
I know. Why he…
…it’s OK, never mind. I’ll, I’ll just clarify with him ‘la’. It’s OK, no problem.
I’m just asking… I understand he is asking about the staircase incident.
‘Mm’.
‘Mm’.
I just…
…just asking like that like body contact when getting the number, is it an offence? Then this fellow keep on telling me ‘uh’ ‘wa’…
Never mind, let’s get this ‘uh’ thing done up properly ‘ah’. All right, so you, you just want to clarify with me ‘la’…
‘Ya’.
…if there is a body contact when taking…
Then he keep on talking about the staircase thing. I…
…the number. OK, never mind, I’m, I’m, I’m, I’m…
‘Ah’…
…summarising back for you, OK? So, ‘uh’ you’re asking me whether is there an offence ‘la’.
‘Ya’.
I’m not saying that there’s an offence. ‘Uh’…
‘Ya’. I’m asking only.
‘Ya’, so no problem, no problem ‘ah’. All right, so we’re clear on that ‘ah’. OK, now ‘uh’… OK, because Police ‘uh’ was informed…
I understand.
…‘ah’, at the staircase, ‘uh’ when you and Esther were at the staircase, you put your hand underneath her skirt.
‘Wa’…
OK?
That… I…
You tell me if you don’t understand ‘ah’, I…
I understand.
Understand ‘ah’? You understand?
I didn’t do such a thing, why must get me in trouble?
‘Ya’ but… OK, I’m telling you, I’m telling you what we were being informed ‘la’. So I want to hear from you.
Then what for she follow me go and take Grab for what?
‘Mm’. OK, so ‘uh’ just calm down, OK?
‘Ya’, then she go and take lift or escalator ‘la’. Why you want to…
‘Mm’ ‘mm’.
… “‘Eh’, I follow you to go down ‘la’.” For what?
OK, so she was saying that ‘ya’ ‘uh’ she will follow you to go down to take Grab, right? This is what you just said. Never mind, so…
Then ‘ya’ if you don’t follow me, then I no need to come to Cantonment already.
‘Mm’. OK, so that one ‘uh’ it, it has already passed ‘la’. So we can hear…
Passed? Now I’m getting in trouble ‘leh’.
‘Ya’… no, we… so now I want to hear from you, OK? So this is what were being informed ‘ah’.
‘Ya’.
OK, so you listen carefully ‘ah’. So, you put your hand underneath the skirt, push aside her underwear…
I know. You already said, finger…
…and ‘ya’ you put your finger insider her vagina ‘la’, so…
Is she stupid or what?
‘Mm’ ‘hm’. So what, what will be your response? How will you respond?
I did not do such a thing. We were already so ‘gan chiong’, unable to get out ‘leh’.
‘Mm’.
We can’t even get out of the ‘uh’…
Staircase.
…walk out ‘leh’.
‘Mm’. OK, so you just told me that ‘uh’ this could not have happened.
Then if…
You… both of you were panicky…
‘Ya’. If…
…because you all cannot get out of the building, right?
If like this, I won’t go and message Ah Heng for help.
‘Mm’.
Then if like this message Ah Heng, I’d rather be at the staircase enjoy, enjoy, correct?
‘Mm’ ‘hm’.
Then what for I go and message Ah Heng for help? If like that, I will not stay at the staircase to enjoy slowly?
‘Mm’. OK. So ‘uh’…
Just a while only ‘leh’ and she disappeared already.
‘Mm’.
Correct or not? I, I…
OK, I, I got you, I got you.
…at staircase enjoy more better, right?
I got you.
Why go and message Ah Heng?
I got you. OK, so ‘uh’ about… I’ll summarise.
You understand, right?
I’ll summarise, then ‘uh’ Mr Vincent, you just correct me if I got his int… ‘uh’ his interpretation wrong. So, ‘uh’ Mr Tang here has told me that he… that time the both of them were panicky at the staircase already because they couldn’t get out. So if he has indeed done what ‘uh’ what was reported, why would he go and message…
‘Ya’.
…Ah Heng for help. He would rather…
I’d rather go and enjoy…
…stay in the staircase… ‘uh’ stairwell and…
‘Ah’.
…enjoy himself. Correct?
‘Ya’.
No, no mis… No misunderstanding…
No.
…on this ‘ah’?
‘Ya’.
OK. All right, so ‘uh’ basically I’ve come to an end of this interview ‘la’, all right. Do you have anything to say or anything to clarify?
What is there for me to say? It is already like this. Already like this. Then I got nothing to say ‘la’.
‘Mm’.
Correct or not? Common sense ‘ma’. If I touch her, I’d rather at the staircase there enjoy.
‘Mm’.
Enjoy until I ‘shiok’, right? What for I go and message Ah Heng for help? Some more, I’m alone ‘leh’, I message Ah Heng for help ‘leh’, open the door. I’m alone ‘leh’. Then she already, like, tell me ‘ah’ the Grab reach already ‘la’. I… then she just walk away.
‘Mm’.
Then I’m alone ‘leh’. ‘Ya’.
‘Mm’.
Then common sense ‘ma’. If she walk away, why don’t I catch her back and enjoy ‘leh’?
‘Mm’ ‘hm’.
Why she go and take Grab? I can pull her back what since ‘uh’ like the both of us or what… why won’t I want? I’d rather message Ah Heng? Because I got tell Ah Heng before, I do not want to have anything to do with your waitress, like, if later on got ‘sabo’ or what.
‘Mm’. OK, stop you ‘ah’. So ‘uh’ you have ever told Ah Heng that you have… don’t want…
‘Ah’.
…to have anything to do with…
That is…
…his wait…
…waitresses because you want to avoid any…
‘Ya’.
…misunderstanding or sabotage ‘la’.
Even if I ask waitress…
…go out eat or what, I will ask Ah Heng.
‘Mm’ ‘hm’. ‘Oh’, so you ask Ah Heng if you…
Like…
…‘uh’…
…must be 3 persons.
Ever ask the waitress to go out?
‘Ah’ like eat together later, I, you, Ah Heng go eat together.
‘Mm’. So have you ever went out with any of the waitresses?
No ‘la’, only Ah Heng. Only Ah Heng.
Only Ah Heng?
Because Ah Heng 10:30 finish work, she need to clear up the tower, tower. Then clean the table, mop the floor. So I wait for him until maybe 11pm, 11pm plus like this. Then we go eat together.
‘Mm’. OK, all right. So, anything else you want to say before we end this interview?
Nothing to say.
Nothing more already ‘ah’. OK, can. I will stop the interview now ‘ah’.
‘Ya’.
OK, ‘uh’, Mr. Tang Mun Keong.
‘Ya’.
Alright, this is the 3rd interview.
“...”
I have to apologise...
‘Ya’.
...earlier on our interview was not recorded. There was some technical issues and so now...
...I am reading back the notes that was taken during the interview earlier on at 1702 hours.
“...”
Which is 5:02 pm. OK. So, ‘uh’, with me is the interpreter, Mr Vincent, I’m going to read back ‘uh’ the contents of our interview earlier on, in English and if you have any clarification or you do not understand, ‘uh’ Mr Vincent will assist to interpret back to you in Mandarin. OK? So you are comfortable speaking in a mixture of English and Mandarin right? That was what I understand from the first and the second interview.
Yes.
OK? Alright. So, ‘uh’, this interview is being recorded to ensure what you said is properly documented ‘la’.
Yes.
So it may be play back to the Court, Prosecutors and Defence Counsel. OK. Are you feeling OK for me to continue? Just to read back to you what transpired earlier on.
OK.
OK, thank you. So, ‘uh’, earlier on, I started off by asking you have seen a doctor for your ‘uh’ swelling on the head and I asked you how you sustain the injury.
So just now ‘uh’ because of your head ‘uh’ injury so you have seen a doctor, then he ask you what happened.
‘Mm’ ,so this is what you said, OK? “I felt that it was not worth it, because of the 50 dollar. Because I did not buy Esther ladies’ drink. She said “Let the boss earn, might as well the 50 dollars you give me.” which is ‘uh’, you give her, so she say “You all just do light petting, like touching.” OK, so, I asked that you mention some things...that were not ‘uh’, mentioned in your previous interview ‘la’.
‘Mm’.
OK, but my question to you is about your head injury and you said something about hitting yourself that was earlier on. OK, so I ask you a direct question, “Why did you hit yourself?” So
your answer was you felt stupid, you felt stressed. Because you allowed her to go to the staircase with you. Because of the 50 dollars, you caused yourself to be in this situation.
‘Yup’.
Alright. So you drank some alcohol, you told her you want to take a staircase and she said “OK, we walk together.” She herself did not want to walk 1 round to the escalator and the staircase was just nice there. So, my direct question is “What happened to your forehead?” So, you said “They keep asking you about Esther, OK, if there was your DNA found and how. You were trying to protect her, meaning, Esther, as because she told you not to say it out and don’t tell her boss. So maybe she find it abit embarrassing to do that for 50 dollars.” So my direct question to you was, “So did, so you hit your head on the table?” you said “Yes”.
Yes.
And ‘uh’ I ask you what else did you do to your head?
You say you punch your own head yourself. “And what else did you do to your head?” You said you hit your head on the table and bang it against the wall. So, I ask you “Earlier on, you say that they ask you what, if your DNA was found.” So I ask you “who are the ‘they’ ?” you said “There’s a Madam and there’s a Malay Officer.” So I ask you “Are you feeling OK now?” And your answer was not OK. Because you know you might be charged and go jail. You felt that it is not worth it because of 50 dollars, you have to go through this.
So far, am I correct?
Correct.
‘Ya’, you understand ‘ah’?
‘Ya’.
OK, so I ask you, “Earlier on, when I was, when I ‘la’, me...”
‘Mm’.
...OK, coming down to this regional lockup with you ‘ah’...
‘Mm’.
You told me that there’s something else you want to tell me that was not mentioned in the first interview. So now you are being seen by the doctor, ‘uh’, would you like to tell me what was it ‘la’? So, you explain to me ‘uh’ that this 50 dollars she wanted to earn. The first interview you did not say, because she is still young. ‘She’ meaning Esther ‘ah’, so she is still a young girl and it is very shameful for her to say it out. OK, you felt that she is still very young and to let people know that she is just doing this for 50 dollars, it will affect her reputation.
So, for 50 dollars, she let people hug, touch and masturbate. This was what...you told me ‘ah’. Alright? So I ask you “What do you mean?” So, your response was you mean that just for 50 dollars, let the guy touch. You think that is it worth it. So she, meaning Esther, told you that she has no choice because she need money and that was the reason why she come back to DNA to work as a waitress.
So, she told you this when the 2 of you all were inside the staircase. And this was what she said ‘ah’, according to you. She said “Ah Keong, can I ask you something?” You ask her, “What?” So she said that you usually buy ladies’ drink for waitress but you never buy for her. So she told you for 50 dollars, she will allow petting. So, your English was not very good, she explained the meaning of petting to you.
So, you understand that it was something along the line of...
Touch...
...touching. And she was willing to do that for 50 dollars. And she told you cannot do more than that. So far, correct ‘ah’?
“...”
OK.
So what do you understand by “You cannot do more than that”, that was my question to you. So you say “Just light petting, touch, touch only.” You also don’t understand what light petting means exactly. She, meaning Esther, say that “You want to touch, just touch ‘la’, but not too much.” That was what Esther said to you.
‘Ya’, I still don’t, don’t understand want to touch just touch.” heavy or light I also...
‘Mm’.
‘Uh’.
And ‘uh’, she said...
...quickly, do it quickly before her Grab comes.
‘Ya’.
So, this whole conversation, ‘uh’, between you and her, took place about 5 minutes or so at the staircase.
‘Mm’.
Then, you message Ah Heng to help to open the door and ‘uh’, Esther was not around already.
‘Mm’.
OK, so my question, next question to you was, “Did you take up the offer of ‘uh’ 50 dollars to touch her?” So you ask her only 50 dollars for that little while you actually don’t, don’t want to, but she was telling you that “It’s just 50 only, if you don’t tell anyone, she will also not tell anyone.”
‘Ya’, OK.
So, did, initially you also still didn’t, didn’t want it, but she say that she needed money. So you give her 1 50 dollar note, she took it and she left. So, my question to you was “The light petting took place before or after you gave her the money?” So, your answer was it was after you gave her the money, you touch abit only. She hugged...
‘Mm’, also did. ‘Yup’.
So, she hugged with you and then tell you, you can touch the outside of the vagina. So...
‘Ah’...
Sorry?
It’s not “You cannot”, its “If you want, you can touch ‘la’”.
If you want, you can touch ‘ah’, that was what she said to you.
‘Mm’.
OK.
She said, “Since you already gave me the money...”
‘Mm hm’.
“...then you want to touch, touch ‘ah’ , just don’t go too far.” So I said OK ‘lor’.
So, she, she told you that since you have given her the money...
...you want to touch, you can touch. But not go ‘uh’ too deep. Is that what she said?
I think so ‘ah’ .
You think so.
I, I also don’t really understand. She is an  ‘Ang moh pai’
OK, so, when you say she “Ang moh pai” means ‘uh’, she is English speaking.
English, ‘ah’.
So, she talk to you in English or in Mandarin?
English.
English? No Mandarin at all? Entirely in English?
Because with my friend, ‘uhm’ my friend say she’s Esther, I say “‘Ya’, I know”, then she ask me “‘Eh’, how you know my name?”
‘Mm’.
Also speak in English.
OK, so, the pre, earlier interaction...
‘Ya’, all in English.
...was also in English ‘la’.
So, all the while she talk to you in English ‘ah’?
‘Mm’.
So, I talk to you in English do you understand or not?
A little bit ‘la’.
‘Eh’, cannot a little bit know?
‘Uh’, ‘uh’, OK .
‘Uhm’, you have to...
Simple, simple OK ‘la’.
But if you don’t understand you got to stop me.
‘Ah’, ‘ya’. ‘Ya’.
So, earlier on ‘ah’...
We, we talk, for like the past 10 minutes, do you understand me or not?
Understand.
Sure ‘ah’?
Sure.
Every word you understand ‘ah’?
Every.
OK. Don’t understand must tell me ‘ah’.
OK.
Great. So, ‘uh’, ‘uh’, I back to, go back to this ‘uh’...entry ‘ah’, that ‘uh’, was recorded at 5:19pm ‘ah’, so, I ask you “The light petting took place before or after you gave her the money?” So, your answer was after. You touch abit only, she hug with you, then she told you ‘uh’, she, like what you ‘uh’, explained earlier on ‘la’, you clarify that ‘uh’, she told you that you want to can ...
...touch ‘la’.
‘Mm’.
OK, but ‘uhm’, ‘uh’, a little bit only. There was...
...was what she said to you, correct? So when you were touching the outside of her vagina, you felt that the vagina was wet and slippery.
So, in the process, your finger did went in a little bit.
‘Ya’.
So, you use your right hand middle finger... ‘uh’, but went deep, how deep, you do not know.
‘Ya’. And the, also, I, I don’t even know what is I, I think ‘hor’ heavy, I think light, it already go inside.
OK. ‘Ya’, so earlier on ‘la’, ‘uh’...in the, in the earlier interview, that was not recorded, so you show me ‘uh’, your right hand middle finger. Correct?
‘Ya’.
And I, you, you pointed to somewhere ‘uh’ with the finger. Can you show it to me again? ‘Uh’, can you show it to me again?
Which is to say to let him see ‘ah’.
Which is like…
The middle finger of the right hand correct?
‘Ya’. Middle finger.
‘Uh’, of your right hand ‘ah’?
‘Ya’.
OK. So, part of your finger did went in ‘la’.
‘Ya’.
Then it was about 2 to 5 times then she told you “OK already.”
Less than 5 time.
Less than 5 times.
She say “OK, enough.”
Enough ‘ah’. Her...
She...
...her Grab was reaching ‘la’. So she left ‘la’.
‘Yup’.
So you waited at the staircase... ‘uh’ ...that was after you messaged Ah Heng, then he did not reply you so you also do not know what to do.
‘Mm’.
Then suddenly you heard the door open...
Then you went up and found one door that was, that can be opened.
‘Mm’.
And when you open the door, it leads to the multi-storey carpark.
‘Mm’.
OK, and from there, ‘uh’, what happened was like what you described in your first interview ‘ah’. So my next question to you was “This part about ‘uh’, 50 dollar, slight petting and ‘uh’ she allowing you to touch her vagina, you did not tell me in the first interview. Correct?” So I ask you “Why you did not say this in the first interview?” So your answer was Esther tell you not to tell anyone.”
‘Yup’.
But now, she ‘sabo’ you, as in, she play you out ‘la’...
‘Mm’.
...and go and lodge a report. You also did not tell Ah Heng or the boss.
OK.
But since she do this to you, you, you are asking whether is it fair to you.
‘Yup’.
So, she said she did not want to...say or did not want to tell anyone but it was she herself now telling everyone that ‘uhm’, this thing happened. So you decided to tell me ‘uh’ what actually happened between the 2 of you. Correct? So far understand ‘ah’? OK, so, you also explain that you wanted to share with me alone earlier on because your English was not very good, so you are unable to talk to the…communicate.
‘Ah’, communicate...
...you used the more better word than...
...I’ve said. So, unable to communicate with the Malay IO and ‘uh’, regarding the...the lady, the female officer, you felt embarrassed to talk about it. That’s why you chose...
Chose you.
... ‘uh’ to talk to me ‘la’. Since I’m a male officer and I’m Chinese and Chinese speaking. Right, so, you also clarify again that you really wanted to say that you don’t understand what was light or heavy petting. So I ask you “OK, you don’t understand, and Esther explained to you, so what was the explanation that she gave you?” Alright, so, you told me that Esther explained to you is “Just touch, touch only.”
So...
...in your opinion ‘ah’, you think if light petting is touch touch ‘ah’, then heavy petting maybe sex ‘la’.
‘Eh’, ‘uh’, ‘ya’. ‘Ya’.
So, in between ‘ah’, you keep saying that ‘uh’, you are going to jail. So I ask you “Why do you keep thinking that you will be jailed because of this?” So your answer...
…was because you touch the girl...
‘Ya’.
Whether light petting or heavy petting, you also touch her already. Maybe is like molest, but you don’t think you molested her because she told you, you can do light petting.
Then after that you changed your mind and say “Never mind ‘la’, touch means touch already.” Then you ask me will you go to jail as a punishment. Because you think this is possibly you are going to jail.
‘Ya’, maybe I very confirm also.
So...uh, earlier on ‘uh’, I also explain to you ‘la’, like, ‘uh’, I will address your these concern ‘uh’ later on because we are still ‘uh’, in the, in, in this interview. Right. So, I asked you before 2 of you went to the staircase, any of these conversation took place ‘la’. Meaning, the conversation about ‘uh’, light petting for 50 dollars, for money, ‘uh’, did any of, did you all talk about this before you all go to the staircase? You say no.
You only told her that you want to take the staircase and when both of you are at the staircase, this was what Esther say ‘ah’, “Ah Keong, wait, wait...”
“I want to ask you something.” Alright, so, she also say that
“I know Ah Heng is your friend, but you must promise me you cannot tell Ah Heng or my boss.” So you ask her “what she wanted to...”
“...tell you?” So she then tell you that ‘uh’...you give her 50 dollars for ‘uh’ , instead of the ladies’ drink, you give her 50 dollar, she let you do something to her. Right? So, following down, I have also asked you like “How much you earn as a pest controller?” You say about 1700 and ‘uh’ every 2 weeks you receive about 650 dollars...
80.
680 ‘huh’? OK. And ‘uh’ you will give half of it to your mom...
...and then the other half for your own usage ‘la’. So it is around half of the 680 per two weeks you will give it to your mom. And you are left with about 300 plus 400 for your own use.
‘Ya’.
So I ask you how often do you patronise the bistro you say you go there about once a week and ‘uh’, you will usually buy 1 or 2 towers of beer when you go there, 1 tower cost about 68 dollars right? And ‘uh’ sometimes you get ladies’ drink for the waitress who you know better and regard them as friends and you can talk to them. So, lastly I ask you, “Do you have anything else you want to say?” You say that you hope you won’t be jailed, ‘uh’...I mean everybody makes mistakes. OK, and the earlier ‘uh’ video recorded interview ended at 1744 ‘la’...
...which is 5:44 pm, alright, OK, so I have read over to you...
...the content of ‘uh’, what was our, what, what we spoke earlier on ‘ah’ that unfortunately was not recorded.
‘Uh huh’.
‘Ya’, is everything...
...accurate?
Say it out.
‘Uh’, yes.
Yes ‘ah’. Do you understand every single thing I’ve said?
Yes.
So there’s no misunderstanding? ‘Uh’...any other things that you wish to say before I conclude this recording?
Jass and other customer ‘la’.
“Jass and other customer”? ‘Uh huh’?
So called my friend, my new friend ‘la’.
‘Mm’.
And got tell me this Esther ‘ah’ will like to body contact with guys like...
‘Mm’.
…like to make those guys jealous, they already want it.
‘Mm’.
‘Ya’, but I like when I take the stairs  ‘ah’ , she follows me and I say OK to it  ‘leh’ . ‘Mm’ .
OK. So you were saying that ‘uh’ Jass and the other customers...
‘Mm’.
...had ever warned you about Esther ‘la’, like, she like to get close to guys, and even when you go staircase, she also followed you.
‘Ya’. I didn’t think too much on this girl ‘lor’ . Need to be careful. I  just said “OK ‘lor’...”
‘Mm’.
“…just walk together ‘lor’ ...”
‘Mm’.
Since her Grab ‘ah’ coming soon.
Alright. OK, anything else?
Nothing else.
Nothing else ‘ah’, then I will end the interview. Thank you.

So what you told us just now is you took…brought us to the toilet, the carpark, the staircase and you showed us outside the pub ‘la’.
‘Ah’.
Where a few which include you, your friends and Esther were outside smoking and talking. Did you bring us…did you show us any…bring us to any other place? Or just these locations ‘la’/
I think only outside the pub, toilet, multi-storey carpark…I think like these only.
OK, can. OK so we go 1 step at a time first ‘huh’. So, first you showed us where DNA Bistro Bar is located at.
‘Ya’.
Is that correct?
Correct.
So did anything happen inside the bar? The bistro?
Inside the pub, no.
Inside the pub, no. So what you said earlier was, you showed us outside the area…
‘Ya’, right.

Smoking.
So that was the space directly outside of the pub.
Correct.
Correct ‘ah’?
Yes.
OK, then thereafter you showed us…where the toilet is.
‘Mm’.
So can you describe to us what happened at the toilet?
After I come out from the toilet, then I saw this Esther.
OK.
Then she asked me ‘uh’…how you know my name? Then…because I…I quite… ‘tsk’… ‘uh’ how to say? ‘Tsk’ I, I often do come to this pub ‘la’.
Why?
Because, because this pub is my friend pub ‘la’. Then…and I also heard some customer mentioned her name. ‘Ya’. Then sometimes I will ask my friend like, today who working ‘la’?
So my friend will send me the…the…name list ‘ah’. Name list then, ‘ya’. So… ‘tsk’, ‘uh’ that day is my first time see Esther ‘la’, ‘ya’. So she, she, she asked me how I know the name ‘la’. Then I ex…I remember explained to her ‘la’.
OK. So you’re saying that all these…
And she…

Outside, ‘ya’. Then she asked me for my number because she say ‘uh’…
…like, ‘tsk’, Tuesday ‘huh’, I got a…I got working, can come support me ‘ah’ reservation or what ‘la’. Then after that ‘uh’ she says ‘uh’ you wait ‘ah’, I go pee first ‘uh’ pee, pee, pee ‘ah’. ‘Ah’, then I say OK. Then wait…I wait outside, the s…outside the steamboat there.
OK, can. I s…paused here for a while ‘huh’. So you told us that when you bumped into Esther at the toilet, you just finished using the toilet.
‘Ya’.
When you came out you saw Esther…
‘Ya’.
…going to the toilet.
.
So you called out to Esther. So…
Chit chat a while ‘la’.
Chit chat a while, so the reason why you know her name is because ‘uh’…when you…before you went to the pub, you asked your friend…
‘Uh’ no I never explained to her…how I…
‘Ya’, you never explained to her ‘la’…
‘Ah’.
…but you, you explained to us that how…the reason why you know her name is because usually before you go to the bistro ‘huh’, you will ask your friend who is working there. Who…what friend is this?
‘Uh’, Got ‘uh’ …
…like…
The name?
Ah Heng.
Ah Heng. You’ll ask Ah Heng where…who is working, then Ah Heng will tell you who are the waitresses…
‘Ya’.

Correct.
…day.
OK. So…you were talking to Esther then she asked you to…
…support her because…
…
…she is working on Tuesday.
‘Ya’.
Which she asked you to go down and support her. And then she asked you to wait for her. Is there any reason why she asked you to wait for her?
Not wait for her. ‘Uh’ she, she, she say she go pee first.
‘Ah’, OK.
‘Ah’. We talked later ‘la’. I said OK, you go first.
‘Orh’ so she said talk later.
‘Ya’, then meet her at the back.
‘Uh’…for…   come back like hug at the waist there
Hug at the waist.
‘Ah’ like this. OK ‘ah’ …   …‘la’. Hug, hug like that. Hug, hug, hug.
Hug face to face or?
‘Ya’. ‘Uh’…I forget already ‘ah’ like…
Where, where were you all standing at when you all… hug, hugged each other? How were your position?
I face there. After that…she got turn over then we have hug, hug her.
Can you…  …
OK. ‘Ah’. You, you and her at that time, the position which is to say that is just face…how? This? It was that she was standing…
I was from the toilet…
…over at where around you?
…I was out from the toilet…
‘Mm’.
… I was out from the toilet…
I was facing like that. You are facing like that ‘la’.
So you and her are face to face.
It was not face to face ‘la’.
‘Uh huh’.
I walked like that…
‘Uh’ sit down, sit down.
…‘orh’. I walked like that, after that you walked over.
‘Ah’.
After that ‘huh’, she would lean closer to me, then…
Side by side ‘la’.
So she was beside…
So it was, so it was…
Touched her…your shoulder touched her shoulder ‘la’.
‘Ah’, correct.
So side…the side of the body…side, side…
‘Ya’.
‘Ah’.
Because I came out then I say… “‘Eh’ Esther.”
How?
Then she just said “‘Eh’? How come you know my name ‘huh’? Like, ‘tsk’…  that kind ‘la’,
So, so you meant to say that you all were like that…
…coming towards each other that time the side of your body…
‘Mm’.
…touched each other.
Because when you take the phone number, definitely would…
Because very close ‘la’. OK.
Definitely would.
So was it that she lean close to you or that you lean close to her?
Both also have ‘la’.
Which is that overall your bodies did have contact ‘la’.
Also close…   … ‘la’.
By the side, Ok
So that means what you told us…correct me if I’m wrong ‘huh’, Mr Vincent, being that when you all came out from the…when she came out from toilet, the both of you were side by side with each other ‘la’. So she…from the side of her shoulder did…
‘Uh’ she…
…brushed against the side of your shoulder.
‘Ya’.
Is that correct?
‘Ya’.
You understand what I’m saying ‘huh’?
Which is to say that you all were out…when you were out of the toilet that time, you all were side…
‘Ya’.
…the side of the body did have contact.
OK.
But not be…but not actually hugging yes your hand was not over her ‘la’.
Got, got ‘la’ but not hugged until like very tight that kind ‘la’. Then after that she say she go…
So you hugged her when she’s beside you.
‘Ah’.
So it was that you ‘uh’ used your hand…which is to be in contact with where about on her body?
I think waist ‘ah’.
Waist ‘ah’. So ‘uh’ my hand…it was 1 hand or 2 hands?
I forgot already ‘la’. Should be hugging…forgot already
So it should be 2 hands, is it? OK. I think ‘uh’ I used…
Not very clear because at that time I did drink a bit of alcohol also ‘la’.
‘Mm’. So not certain was it 1 hand or 2 hands.
‘Mm’. But it was not…I would not drink until very drunk. Like I don’t get …
OK. ‘Mm’.
….myself drunk…
So…so, so what you’re saying is that ‘uh’…basically you…did hug her briefly ‘la’ but not very tight ‘la’. You s…
‘Uh’…
….it’s either 1 or 2 hands which you don’t remember because you drank a l…little.
‘Mm’.
But you were not drunk at that time…
I s… ‘ya’.
…so you remember what happened ‘ah’.
‘Ya’.
OK. So after that ‘uh’…I believed…you…just now said then you went out to wait for her and then you sat at…
‘Mm’.
…this steamboat place.
‘Ya’.
Which was another location where you…brought us to. Correct? You showed us where you sat.
‘Ya’.
Wait for her. OK. So, can you tell us what happened?
And the she come out and say…and then she come out, and then I stand up ‘la’, I say I want to go already. And then I say I don’t want to go that side ‘la’. Then I… ‘tsk’ because…
When you said…hold on ‘huh’, when you said that side…which side do you mean?
That side is e…e…escalator ‘ah’.
OK.
I did not want to walk so far. And…
OK, you don’t want to walk too far. OK.
‘Ya’, I don’t want then I after that…sorry. ‘Uh’ I after that… ‘uh’ I say, I want to walk by the stairs. ‘Eh’…
…sorry, ‘uh’ I want to walk staircase ‘la’ because near the toilet ‘ma’.
‘Mm hm’.
Then also convenient ‘ma’.
‘Mm hm’.
And then once, ‘uh’… ‘uh’ like once walked down which is downstairs already ‘ma’.
So once you go down, it’s level 1.
‘Uh’ level 1, then…
OK.
…I also did not want to walk too far. ‘Ah’, I, I just wanted to walk by the stairs ‘la’. Which was to level 1…
…can go and take the MRT. Or take Grab ‘la’.
‘Mm’.
Then after that…
So I can reach a…take the staircase, I can reach…   …level 1 and then I’ll take ‘uh’ MRT home.
Or take a Grab ‘la’.
A Grab.
And then…so, this Esther ‘uh’ ‘tsk’…just say “‘Eh’ I, I also booked Grab already ‘leh’. OK, OK, walk together ‘la’.” Like, go, go together. I say “‘Huh’?” And then she say, “‘Ah’ OK ‘lor’, go together”. I said ‘uh’ “‘Orh’, OK ‘lor’”.
So who’s the one who... sugges…Esther suggested to go together?
No, I…
You suggested, OK. So, so just to summarize, correct me ‘huh’, you told us that when Esther…you were sitting down waiting for Esther. When she came out, you stood up.
‘Ah’.
And approached her then you told her that you have to go already.
‘Uh huh’.
But you’re taking the staircase instead of the escalator.
‘Ya’.
Because it’s faster to reach level 1 where you can either take the MRT or take Grab.
‘Ya’.
Then Esther told you that she had also booked a Grab already. So you suggested that the 2 of you go down the staircase together ‘la’.
‘Mm’.
Correct? Then after that?
After that…‘uh’…we try to open the door. Then, all the door is locked.
Wait ‘huh’. So just to confirm ‘huh’. When you were walking towards the staircase right, there was no body contact right? This was what you told us in your previous interview.
No, no body contact.
No body contact at all ‘huh’ while walking towards the staircase ‘huh’?
But I opened the door, sure would have brushed against one ‘ma’.
‘Ya’. S…‘uh’…‘ya’, so what you said is…when opening the door, there were some…
‘Uh’…
…it’s brushing of the body but that was when you all were opening the door ‘la’. Before that while walking there was no body contact at all.
OK, can. So, after that you brought us to the staircase area. Is that correct?
‘Ya’.
OK. Then can you tell us what happened at the staircase?
‘Uh’ that one…
But what, what did you show us?
‘Uh’…
When you went…when you brought us to the staircase, what did you show us?
‘Ya’. Then we wanted to find ‘uh’ we want to find the exit ‘ah’. Then we keep on try to open the door but it’s locked ‘la’.
It’s locked. We before that ‘huh’, this Esther got asked me ‘la’, ‘uh’ which was while walking and while chit chatting ‘la’. Then
She just asked me ‘uh’ “Is it that you often come to this pub?”
So while we were walk…walking to the staircase, ‘uh’ we were chatting. And Esther asked me whether I ‘uh’ visit the…this pub ‘uh’ frequently.
‘Mm’. Then I just told her that ‘uh’…for me, it would be a long while that weekend would, ‘uh’ would come on weekday. Come 1, 1, 2 times. Then usually it is Saturday. Or maybe… ‘uh’…for a week like, maybe, for a… ‘eh’ it is not, for a month, maybe come 1, 2 times only.
‘Mm’. I told her I come ‘uh’ occasionally. Maybe ‘uh’ once or twice a month. ‘Uh’ ‘ya’ u…usually on a weekend.
‘Ya’.
Can. I understand. So all these ‘uhm’ was already covered in the previous…
OK.
…interview already.
Then…
So I just…want to confirm ‘huh’. I mean, I mean…the s…what, what happened, you know. So, I just want to confirm that when you went, when you went…when you brought us to the staircase, what you did was, you showed us.
‘Ya’.
You…basically you walked down 1 flight of stairs. From level 2 you showed us the entry in. There was 2 door that you opened.
Which was just opened that…
Correct?
…   …Bistro that?
‘Mm’.
It…OK.
So you opened 2 door, you all walked down the stairs.
And then we start to chit chat.
So you were telling us that…you cannot remember exactly where you were touching…
‘Ya’.
At which spot you were touching Esther.
‘Mm’.
It could be 1 flight of stairs down.
‘Ya’.
Or it could be 2 flights of stairs down. Is that correct? ‘Mm’ you interpret …
You…which is also to say that you….
I, I…   …
…‘uh’ that staircase there, you were down…is it going down 1, 1, 1…1, 1, 1…1…the first of that one ‘ah’…
‘Ah’ just like that, which is it ‘lor’.
‘Ah’, that flight of stairs, for the first one…
I…I…
…there is a...
…am able to understand.
…the stair landing there. Or is it the second one…
Understand.
‘Ya’ I understand.
You at over at there…
OK.
Or was it at the first one or the second one, you touch…touched her? ‘Ah’.
OK, can. So, so…you…this…you, you were telling us ‘la’, correct? Either… ‘uh’ you do not know exactly which spot. You cannot remember already.
‘Ya’.
So what you also told us was that…
…after it happened, Esther went off…by herself. She walked down. Then you went back up to level 2…
‘Ya’. And then…
…you try to open the door but you are…
Still closed then I asked…
Still closed.
…Ah Heng for help ‘la’.
‘Mm’. But then…
But he didn’t reply me or ‘uh’…
…I forgot he…did I call him or not ‘leh’.
‘Wa’.
No, no worries if you forgot it’s fine ‘la’.
Never mind but I, I got messaged Ah Heng I said…
‘Mm’.
… “Heng, the…” ‘uh’ but…‘uh’…like I need help ‘la’ because the door is closed ‘la’.
‘Mm’.
‘Uh’, the door is locked. ‘Ya’, then…he never reply me ‘la’. ‘Ya’, so after that Esther… ‘uh’ …walked down ‘ah’.
‘Mm hm’.
Go, go downstair ‘ah’.
‘Mm hm’.
So then ‘uh’…‘ah’ ‘uh’ Esther walked down the stairs and ‘uh’ …
I asked her wait ‘la’. I, I say I already messaged Ah Heng ‘ma’. I asked for help but she, she never ‘la’. So, she leave me alone ‘la’.
OK. Then you try to open the…
‘Uh’…
…so after that you went up to level 3…
‘Ya’…   …
…you showed us that you went up to level 3 right?
‘Ah’, ‘ya’, because Ah Heng, Ah Heng ‘uh’ never reply me.
‘Mm’.
Then Esther already… ‘uh’ gone ‘ah’. ‘Tsk’ gone…
‘Mm hm’…
…then I alone ‘la’. I need help ‘ma’ so I walked…
OK.
…see which door can open ‘la’. I run up and down, see which door can opened then suddenly…I op…I walked till a door I opened ‘huh’, it is able to be opened one.
OK.
But Ah Heng told me that it was…that…the who opened one. Another boss. Another boss, helped, helped me to open one.
So, did you see the boss when the door opened?
Then I heard a sound ‘la’. So I went to open ‘huh’, ‘eh’? It was a carpark.
OK. So…what, what you told us as you, you…
Carpark.
…brought us to level 3, you opened, you show us…
It’s a carpark. Multi-storey.
…it was a multi-storey carpark. Right. So you walked out all the way and then you walked down the slope.
‘Ya’.
All the way out ‘la’.
All the way out until first floor then I…start, ‘uh’ take MRT ‘lor’.
OK. Can. So, earlier you mentioned that ‘uhm’ back when we were…when you brought us to the staircase area right…
‘Ya’.
…you also told us that you did not recognise the staircase landing at level 1. When we walked down, you said that you don’t recognise it and you all did not reach level 1…at all.
No, never.
Correct? So you all also…you also don’t remember trying to open the door at level 1. Is that correct?
‘Ya’.
Correct ‘huh’. OK. However in your first interview right…
…you mentioned that you all had tried to open the door at level 1. So, m…did you all go down to level 1 or did you all not go down to level 1?
For me I’m not sure ‘leh’. Like which is just now I brought you all to go right, for that staircase, they all…some places also did not put 1st storey, 2nd storey ‘ma’, maybe we all walked up, walked down, ran until 3rd storey, we all also do not know ‘ah’. We all opened, opened and opened, kept on being unable to open.
OK.
If…how to say ‘huh’, ‘uh’…OK.
OK, will pause you here so the interpreter can translate for us ‘la’.
OK, wait for a while ‘huh’.
‘Uh’, if I am able to open the door ‘huh’….
‘Mm’.
…I would just not have messaged Ah Heng already. ‘Ya’.
Because we were running up and down, down and we trying to find a…
Exit.
…door that can be…exit that can be opened. ‘Uh’ ‘ha’ but there’s no indication of the floor lev…‘uh’ level. ‘Uh’ so I don’t know which floor.
OK. So, of…but did…this may not answer the question ‘huh’. So actually did you go down to level 1…
No.
…to open and or…
No.
So, so what you’re trying to say now is ‘huh’ during the first interview, actually you’re not sure, ‘uh’ correct?
‘Uh’ I, I…I walked up to…
So after, after just now we bring you back to the place…
‘Ya’.
…now we bring you back to the place, you are very sure that you never go to level 1.
Never.
Correct?
Never.
That’s what you’re trying to say ‘la’.
‘Ya’.
OK.
I’m very confirmed I never go level 1.
Maybe we go up and down…
OK.
…we ran until 3rd storey, we also do not know ‘ah’.
OK.
Because we all ‘kan cheong’ ‘ma’. ‘Ah’.
‘Mm’. ‘Mm’.
And then…
So you all never tried to open the door at level 1 also. Correct? That you don’t remember
No.
Because you don’t recognise that place ‘la’. Correct?
‘Ya’.
When we brought you down there earlier. OK. So…
…back to this same topic about this staircase. You mentioned that the reason why you wanted to take the staircase was because it was a shortcut…
‘Ya’.
…down to level 1….
Actually…
…to take a Grab.
‘Ya’.
Is that correct?
Correct.
Correct. So…why…
Take Grab or take MRT.
Take Grab or take MRT, so why is it that you never even try to open the door at level 1 since your intention is to take the Grab or MRT?
Because she was together with me, then…
OK.
…we all are unable to open the door ‘ma’, running up, running down. Then…
‘Ya’, correct. So…
…until halfway…
‘Mm’.
…halfway, we all walked the staircase that time, we all did talk ‘la’.
‘Mm’.
Then so until halfway, that…that door ‘ma’, unable to be opened, and she just asked me ‘lor’, “‘Uh’ actually your 50 dollars can give me better than you gave…
OK, can,
…gave your friend”.
I paused you here ‘huh’. So what you’re saying is that…
…‘uh’…
…
What you’re describing to us is that…Mr Vincent correct me if I’m wrong ‘huh’.
…what you described to us earlier is that ‘uh’ …you all were going up and down then halfway…she…brought up the 50 dollars topic which you mentioned in our previous interview. But this…still does not answer my question.
‘Ah’ true.
My question is why did you not even go down to level 1…
‘Ah’.
… to try and open the door? Since your intention is to go down to level 1 to take a Grab…
‘Ya’.
…or MRT.
Because halfway, already that one already.
That one is what?
Like…can say ‘ah’.
‘Ya’, you have to s…I mean…
She…which is she just wanted to ask you. She wanted to know…  .
‘Mm’. It is your chance to explain.
‘Uh’ which is…touched ‘lor’. Touched.
Touch meaning touch.
‘Ah’.
Is that correct?
But she said about giving 50 dollars or what can hug ‘ah’ like, she touched ‘lor’, touched
OK.
Then she said that what ‘uh’ actually ‘tsk’ you also can touch me ‘ma’.
OK. So…
Since you support me.
OK, I stop here ‘huh’. I paused you here. So, you are saying that because halfway through, she already asked you to give her…
‘Ah’.
…50 bucks…dollars to support her and then she in exchange she will allow you to touch her. So halfway through because you all touched her…
‘Ah’.
…so you never went down….
So…
…to level 1.
So after that…after…that…I...I do not know…she wanted or not…‘uh’ …I do not… ‘eh’?
OK. Never…never mind, Mr Tang because we’re going a bit out of point now. So I u…I rephrase my question ‘la’. OK, I changed my question. So the question is, after you touched her…
…why did you not continue going down to level 1 to open the door to leave?
She…
If…
…she say…
…that’s what you wanted.
…she say enough already. I…my Grab is coming. She walked down then I wanted to follow her ‘huh’, then she, she said “Never mind ‘la’. I go first ‘la’”. She maybe scared that people saw ‘leh’? she…I also do not understand her ‘la’.
OK. So what you’re saying is you wanted to follow her…
Because she is very rush.
Hold on. You wanted to follow her but she said never mind, she go down first.
…. ‘ah’.
So you thought maybe she is embarrassed that people see so…
…
…you just let her go first.
I also don’t know right…
Because she says she’s in a rush.
…she in the rush like…I…once go down, I said I…even though I asked her wait, she also don’t want.
OK. So…m…back to my question, so why did you not go down to level 1 after that? To check whether the door can be opened or not…
Because I…
So that you can leave.
…because I message Ah Heng already ‘ah’. I messaged Ah Heng say help me open the door ‘la’.
But why not try level 1?
She went down already and also disappeared already ‘ma’. Then I just heard got the sound of the door ‘ma’ then I just opened. End up it was multi-storey carpark ‘ma’.
OK.
I did heard the opening sound.
OK.
But, but, but…s…going down to 1st storey would be easier, correct?
I know then I heard the sound, that’s why I went back to open, correct or not?
OK.
Correct ‘ah’.
But wouldn’t…so you might…because you told us that…
If...
…the purpose in going to the staircase is because it’s faster to get…reach level 1. So, why instead of going down to level 1 after Esther had left…
If…
…instead of going down level 1, you choose to go up and walked one big round via the multi-storey carpark instead.
Because…because Esther ‘huh’, ‘uh’ she said that she go off first. She did not want…maybe she did not want me to follow her ‘ma’. She said never mind ‘lor’. If…wait for the door to open, I go down first, very…which is very rush.
OK. Because Esther told you…
‘Uh’ maybe…I also do not know…she is afraid to let people see ‘leh’ or was it after doing things ‘leh’, having taken that money and run…walked off, I also do not know ‘la’. ‘Ah’. She was telling me to…
Correct ‘lor’. Actually it is that she can wait for while…
She did not want to wait.
…she went out of the door first and after that you also go out by that door
‘Mm’, you can wait for a while ‘ma’. You can wait for her to go off already, maybe like 5 to 10 minutes later…5 minutes later then you...
Correct ah’.
…can go down.
But then I heard that door ‘huh’, I just open ‘lor’. If I were to follow Esther to go down, that door is closed, is it also not able to be opened, similarly we all would also walked up ‘ma’.
How she manage to open that door?
Correct. Which is that I just did not follow her to go down. I also do not know ‘huh’, she got go out or not. Basically I also do not know.
OK. So you did not follow her.
‘Ah’.
You did not see how she left. Where…
‘Ya’. Basically I also do not know…
...whether or not she left level 1.
…whether she did or not…
The reason why you did not follow her down to level 1 was because she told you that she’s in a rush.
‘Ya’.
She needed to leave first, so you…
She say my Grab come already.
…so you thought you will go up to level 3 instead ‘la’. That’s what you are telling us.
‘Ya’.
You choose to go out from level 3 instead of level 1.
‘Ya’.
Because Esther told you she’s in a rush. Correct?
‘Ya’.
OK. So…
I don’t know is it true ‘la’. Her Grab come already.
Can.
Because I did not follow her.
OK. So you don’t know whether it’s true that sh…she took a Grab ‘la’.
‘Ya’.
Because you didn’t follow her, OK. So the next question, so how long did you all talk for at the toilet?
‘Mm’…toilet…
Do you remember?
Few seconds only ‘la’.
Few seconds only.
Talking ‘huh’?
‘Mm’.
Talking ‘lor’. Then just say that…
‘Ya’, I know you all talked.
…‘uh’…
‘Uh’, how long did you all talk for?
‘Tsk’.
Maybe…1 minute. ‘Uh’ I ‘agar agar’ 1 minute…
‘Mm’.
…which is only how you know my name then took the phone number like hug a while then…
OK.
OK, I go pee.
OK.
Should be less than 1 minute ‘ba’.
OK. So about less than a minute ‘huh’.
I think so ‘la’.
OK, can. I’ll show you a…footage ‘huh’, then I’ll ask you some questions, OK?
Footage is that of just now which I was brought to walk at over there ‘huh’?
‘Mm’. Once you see would just understand already.
OK. We watched ‘huh’. So this is around 11 o’clock ‘huh’, 2300 ‘huh’
‘Ya’.
You see Esther walking in, correct?
‘Ya’.
‘Ya’, it’s OK.
Then I was at boy’s toilet.
‘Mm’, OK, wait a while ‘huh’, So this at about 34 second mark ‘la’.
I think more than 1 minute already.
‘Mm’, never mind, we see first.
OK. We paused here. So ‘uhm’ …earlier we saw Esther going in at about 11…at…it was at 34 second mark ‘la’, so now it’s 1 minute and 52 second past…
‘Mm’.
…11 pm, so…it’s about 1…and a half minute. It was about 1 and a half minute of conversation.
Where would I go and calculate ‘lor’. Correct or not? We all were talking.
OK you did not   … ‘ya’.
…‘ya’ we’re just saying.
‘Orh’.
So what you’re saying is that ‘uh’ you never keep track of the time ‘la’.
‘Ya’.
Is that correct? So…
‘Ah’. Just walked out.
OK, can. So you’re not waiting for her inside the toilet?
No ‘la’.
OK. So you went out to wait ‘la’. Correct?
‘Ya’.
OK. Can continue the…from here.
‘Wa’ very long already. She went to the toilet.
‘Mm’.
So while waiting for her, what were you doing…what were you doing?
‘Mm’?
What were you doing while waiting for her?
I saw my friend ‘ma’. That Ah Heng.
‘Orh’ you saw Ah Heng ‘hor’.
I also did make a call to another guy called Mervin.
So that means you talked to Ah Heng also.
‘Ah’ … he was   ‘ah’.
While waiting for her. OK.
He was closing that pub.
OK.
Then I also did make a call to my friend.
‘Ah’, so while sitting there, you talked to Ah Heng.
‘Ya’, ‘la’.
OK. So now we see Esther coming out right? Over here. This is Esther, correct?
‘Mm’.
OK.
OK, at this 4 minute 40 seconds part, you all were walking towards the staircase.
‘Mm’.
Is that correct?
‘Mm’.
Correct ‘huh’. So it…can continue play. OK, ask you….OK, so over here right, you were seen…can you tell us what you were doing at this part?
‘Uh’, put on her shoulder ‘lor’.
OK. But…
‘Mm’.
…why were you doing that?
I told her that I wanted to walk by the stairs.
OK. But then…earlier right, a…there was a…you told us a few times, more than once that you did not touch her or have any body contact with her at all...while walking to the….
I have…
…staircase. So how do you explain this?
…I told you that I did hug, hug ‘leh’.
‘Ya’, you told us the hugging happened inside the toilet.
‘Ah’, unable to film the toilet ‘ma’. Then I come out, how am I to know ‘ah’.
OK. I repeat my question ‘huh’. Earlier you told us a few times that you did not touch her…
‘Ya’.
…or have any body contact with her while walking to the staircase, which is this portion ‘huh’. While walking to the staircase, there was no body contact. So how do you explain…what do you have to say about this? Can you explain to us?
No, she said that she wanted to go with me to take Grab ‘ma’.
Then I just hold her ‘lor’.
So…why did you tell us that there was no body contact earlier?
Where would I be able to remember so many things? Just now you all were asking me about the staircase things, I also do not remember ‘ma’.
OK. So you’re telling us that you…  …you do not remember.
Then and also I did drink alcohol ‘leh’.
So were you drunk ‘ah’?
But you don’t remember…doing this.
OK. So…
But I know that having gone to the staircase, she did start to ask already.
OK, never mind. We don’t talk about the staircase. We just focus on this ‘huh’. So you’re saying that you put your arm around because she say that…she agree to go to the staircase
with you.
Correct. Really, ‘ah’.
Then how was her reaction when… ‘uh’ you put your hand…
Where would I…it is not possible for me to look and see her reaction ‘ma’.
But m…you your arm around her ‘ma’. You didn’t…wouldn’t you…
She also did not have….
…have notice…
…‘ya’.
…how her reaction is like?
Should be that did not notice ‘la’.  I did not…
You did notice her reaction.
I don't notice.
OK. OK, can. Can continue.
Then opened the door.
OK. And then…you all went in ‘la’.
‘Uh’ I do not know if it was she opened or I opened.
OK. Can.
.
No.
Taking the hand to put on the shoulder, is also an offence ‘meh’?
No ‘la’, I mean ‘uh’ …we just want to clarify ‘la’.
We just want to ask you this question.
…as a…
We just…
…friend, I just…also can like that ‘ma’,
No, because, because we, we just want to ask you…
‘Mm’.
…because you say that there was no body contact but CCTV…
I really…
…show that there is.
‘Ya’, ‘la’ but then….
‘Ah’ so, that’s, that’s why we need to ask you.
Where would I know? It is not possible that I and her…
…‘tsk’…got body contact, where would I have remembered, correct or not?
So… ‘ya’, ‘la’, I mean now that you told us that how…now…
Some more a lot of things ‘ah’.
…now you told us that you cannot remember, then so be it because our, our duty is to clarify with you.
OK. Because you told us you have…you cannot…you, you did not touch her at all. But in the CC…
I did not touch her. I only just like shoulder ‘la’.
And you told us that there is no body contact ‘ma’, initially but now that CCTV shows…
I know.
…that this is and then that’s why we ask you to clarify.
‘Ya’, so our purpose here is just to clarify with you ‘huh’.
I understand.
Which you have explained to us that because you do not remember, OK? So fair enough, ‘uh’…I don’t have any other further questions for you. You got anything else?
Nothing.
I know that putting the hand on the shoulder, should be an offence is it?
OK. I mean…so, so I mean, what you are telling us is that putting the hand…
.
…over the shoulder…
‘Ya’.
…is an offence. OK, I mean we will not make any…
…comment about this.
Because friends with friends like that…
‘Mm’.
‘Wa’.

I…no matter how I say also now it is already filmed that I had put over the shoulder. If it is just only put over the shoulder, need to report to the police ‘huh’, really it is stupid ‘ma’. Friend with friends also can put over the shoulder ‘ma’. ‘Uh’ but…also…

‘Yup’. So ‘uh’…I’ll just read through. So I’m Muhammad Shahnizar Bin Rozlan. I’m staying at Block 969 Hougang Street 91 #07-174 with my wife Farhana and 7 children. So Farhana father and mother are also staying with us.
Farhana brother is also staying here. So yesterday my third daughter, Arilah, was supposed to finish her school at 4 pm in the afternoon. But when I was opening the mailbox at the ground floor at around 6 plus pm, I saw Arilah walking towards the lift. I immediately realised that she only just came home.
I asked her “Where did you go?” She said she met her friend outside her school. I told her “You don’t anyhow mix around with people or stranger”. Because I know she like to anyhow mix with others. I then told her not to lie to me. And to tell me the truth. Because she has been lying to me almost every day. So I then slapped her cheek once. I do not remember which side I slapped. I then enter the lift with Arilah and took the lift to level 15.
I chose level 15 so that we…so that ‘uh’ won’t have other people hear my conversation with Arilah. So at level 15 lift lobby, I talked to Arilah. I told her to tell me the truth. She keep quiet at first but then raised her voice at me. ‘Uh’…she raised her voice at you saying that ‘uh’ “I’m telling you the truth”. So after that you asked her about a message on the handphone.
A guy messaged her, offer to fuck. She said, “I swear I never go fuck”. OK. So I then ‘uh’ repeated for her to tell me the truth because she mixed around with many nonsense people. I
told her, “Don’t make me check your below”, in English.
She raised her voice at me again, “I did not”. After that I take my finger and put inside…my finger into her shorts and panty from the top. I then insert my index finger up to the first joint into her vagina. I also insert very fast, around 2 second. I then pulled out my whole hand. I said to her, “You’re not a virgin”, in English. She then told me she was not virgin because some…got someone raped her before. I then told her, “why did…why did you not tell me?”
She said ‘uh’ she’s scared. I won’t ‘uh’ trust her. So after that I…felt like crying and I hugged her. I told her to please next time tell me. So after that we took a lift from level 15 to level 7 to go home. While walking at level 7 corridor, I told Abilah not to tell anyone about this. I kept telling her if anything happened, just tell me or her mother. After she reached home, I asked her to go shower.
OK. So this is the page 2 ‘huh’. I admit that I did put my finger into her vagina. I did so… ‘uh’…because she lie a lot of times and I don’t trust her. And when I…and I was scared that she’s pregnant. I loved her as my daughter. Statement was recorded and explained to me in English. I affirmed this 2 pages of my statement to be correct.

‘Ah’.
Then after that ‘uh’ she told me that ‘uh’ be…it’s because someone raped her. I said….she, she, she…  … to tell me.

‘Uh’ so that’s all.
So why did you need to insert your finger inside her vagina?
Because I don’t trust her, I was afraid that she was pregnant or something. Because I treat her as my real daughter.
I don’t want her…anything happened to her.
You treat her like real daughter, you don’t want anything to happen, you scared she pregnant. But why do you need to insert your finger to…
Because she lie to me because I was…
Why do you need to insert your finger into her vagina?
I thought…
Why…what are you trying to do actually?
I was checking whether she’s…below that one part is tight or not? Be…I know because I’m, I’m with my wife, I did something…
…something like that…  …with my wife ‘ah’, so I know. So I…  …I just test…  … whether is it tight or not, it was very loose. Then after that I told her, “You are not a virgin”.
So you mean…you…
I, I was…
…you touched, you feel that it’s very loose ‘ah’, you mean?
‘Ya’, ‘ya’.
Is it what you trying to say?
‘Ya’.
‘Mm’.
I didn’t think why am I touching her like that. I was like after I touched I was like very shocked. Why did I touch her?
Why…why did you
I’m like…I don’t know. It’s like I was…lose a trust on her. Like I was pissed off.
You’re pissed off then that’s why you insert.
No, because she like to….
…only like that. Then after that I test whether she lie or… ‘uh’ lie to me or not. Then she was…her virgin was very loose.
So you feel that the…vagina hole was very loose.
‘Ya’.
Is it?
Yes. Down…then after that she give me a real reason that s…she told me that someone raped her ‘ah’. I said who, she keep quiet, she don’t want to tell me.
It’s not that I don’t love her, I loved her as my real daughter.
So when you insert your finger into her vagina…
…did you have any ‘uhm’…sexual desire for her?
I don’t have, Sir. Not at all.
Not at all ‘la’.
Not at all, Sir.
So how can your finger tell whether she’s virgin or not?
I know because I’m with my wife for few years already. Even before marriage, I know my wife. I did the s…I did…  …up my wife before marriage also.
OK.
‘Ya’, so I know ‘la’. I’m 30 years old and I know.
So you know ‘la’.
‘Ya’.
OK. So you don’t have sexual desire?
I don’t have sexual desire with my daughter or whatever it is.

Never did before…
Never.
…this is your first time ‘la’.
Yes, correct, Sir.
On Arilah.
Yes, correct, Sir.
How about other…
Nev…not at all.
Not at all ‘la’.
You can, you can asked my oth…the rest of my daughter personally.
OK. So I want to know the thinking behind. Why do you need to do that?
I’m…   …
To test whether is it tight or not?
I was pissed off because she every lie…every day lie to me. Then she said ‘uh’ about the message I was very, very pissed
off. That one I saw it on Instagram.
OK.
I was very pissed off whether is she…meet that guy or not? I wanted to meet that guy.
OK.
‘Ya’ but I don’t know who. I want to ask her but she say don’t know.
OK. So after that you go back home. You asked her shower then anything happened?
No, she…after that she go inside the room and play play with my other daughters ‘ah’.
So did you tell your…family members or your wife about what you did to her at the 15th floor?
No, I didn’t. Because if I tell my wife, my wife will…might think other, other ways ‘la’.
Like what?
Like wh…why am I…what am I doing with my ‘uh’…her daughter or what ‘la’. ‘Ah’. ‘Uh’ it’s like…what’s that? ‘Uh’…she thought I might have sexual, sexual with my daughter.
OK.
‘Ya’, I don’t want…she think that way ‘la’.
Ryan, you got anything?
‘Ya’.
OK. So, so ‘uh’ you yourself say that ‘uh’ you didn’t tell your wife because you don’t want your wife to think you got sexual desire for Arilah right?
Yes, correct, Sir.
Meaning that ‘uh’ any…anyone who learnt that you put your finger inside…
Anyone what?
…anyone who will find out that you had put your…
‘Ah huh’.
…finger inside Arilah’s vagina right…
‘Ah huh’.
…their, their thinking is that…you want to do sex with her, correct?
‘Ya’, it’s correct, Sir.
So, so…so, so…
I don’t want that to happen ‘la’. And I don’t have the intention to have sex with my daughter. Why must I have sex with my daughter if I have my 2 kids?
I already have my 2 kids. And some more she…I don’t have the…  …the intention, Sir.
OK. The, the thing that I want to ask is because this very act right…
‘Mm’.
…anyone who, who hears about it or sees it right, th…they will…their, their first thing that come to mind right is, you’re doing something sexual to her, correct?
‘Ya’, ‘ya’, obviously ‘la’.
So, so, so, it…it ‘uh’ from your point of view, is this right or wrong?
It’s wrong ‘la’. Because I was pissed off and what she did…she messaged to the person. And I was very afraid that she get pregnant or something.
On that day I was…I did not think.
So, given that you know that…this act is wrong right…
‘Ya’, I, I…
…then why you still do?
…I did not think that way that d… ‘uh’ on the 26th, ‘ah’.
What do you mean that…what do you mean?
I did not think about that ‘la’.
Why?
Because I was like pissed off, like…while I was like mad why she messaged that guy, that kind of person.
What, what were you mad with Arilah about?
Sorry?
What were you angry with Arilah about?
The message on Instagram.
And this message is ‘uh’ she messaged the other party or the other party messaged her?
Both. Both. The…the other party…what I saw that this guy want to meet ‘uh’…Arilah to fuck. Then Arilah accept it.
And the rest of the conversation I did not saw. Then I was showed to my wife ‘la’.
OK.
Then after the…after next day, she deleted the message and
changed the password.
So, so meaning to say…on 26th when you…did this, you didn’t think it was wrong?
I did not think that was wrong because I were…was pissed off and angry ‘ah’.
So, that means you will think that it is fine for you to put your finger into Arilah’s vagina.
No, I did not think that way. I was…I don’t know what’s in my mind. I got…I’m just pissed off.
""...
…OK.
So…
…so, why, why did you feel…that ‘uh’…feel…why did you feel that you have to be the one to check whether Arilah is virgin? Why not get your wife…
Because…
…to do so?
…if my wife, she won’t, she won’t listen to my wife.
Why?
She won’t listen?
Why, why not?
I don’t know. She won’t listen to my wife.
So she will listen to you?
Not s…I don’t think so ‘la’. Because the rest of my kids listen to me a lot. ‘Ya’.
OK.
Every day I played with them inside the house
Even Arilah we run around inside the house.
So, as to why you…don’t get your wife to…re… ‘uh’ check whether is a virgin, because…
I don’t know she, she’s…I don’t know ‘la’. ‘Ah’ because I don’t know what’s in my mind ‘ah’.
You don’t know what is…is in your mind, OK.
I’m just afraid that she got into pregnant ‘ah’. That’s what I’m afraid of ‘la’.
OK. But if, if so, then isn’t…the, the…normal thing to get her a pregnancy test kit? Why, why you…do you need to put your
finger inside her vagina?
I didn’t…not think that way. ‘Ya’.
Then after…after that I was…get shocked after said someone raped her.
That’s the part that I get very shocked. And I felt I wanted to cry ‘la’.
So did you ask who raped her or not?
I did asked who raped. She said don’t know.
She neve…she say don’t know. Ryan, you…  .
OK, OK.
It’s not don’t know. She did not say don’t know. She said…
…I also don’t know what. She said...like don’t want to tell me like that.
‘Mm’.
I don’t know what she said. I don’t remember what she said. She like…the reaction like don’t want to tell me.
OK. So…again ‘huh’, regarding the fact that you never buy ‘uh’ pregnancy test kit for Arilah to check whether she pregnant…
‘Mm hm’.
…like why, why didn’t you choose to use a pregnancy test kit?
Because I did not think that way. I didn’t think that way. About the pregnancy test kit.
Or, or is it because you wanted to ‘uh’ violate…Arilah?
Violate as in?
‘Uh’, OK… ‘tsk’ , ‘uhm’…
To sexually assault her ‘la’.
No. I did not...  …
You wanted to sexually assault Arilah with your finger is it?
I did not have the intention to do that.
Then what was your intention?
I was…m…my intention like, I was checking a bit whether she is virgin or not, that’s all.
After that I find out that after the…below part is loose, I was, I was very shocked that she’s not virgin. Then after that I said “Who did, who did she go with?” Then ‘uh’ after…
So just to be clear, her below part referring to?
‘Uh’ the below part ‘la’.

Prior to this you invited another Chinese lady named Amanda to join, to the club. You met her when you were taking your bike license together then ‘ah’ you talked. You all talked then you asked her if she parties, so invited to the club.
So at the club all your drinks were maid Amanda and some other people so you remember she told you that there was orange mixed with whisky and you are not. You are not a good drinker and you told her about it. So you think that you drank about ten glasses or more and you also mixed drinks. Apart from drinking you also went to the dance floor with Amanda. Remember you were making out vigorously. She took your ‘uh’ dick and then you finger her vagina.
Most of the time you were kissing at the dance floor, it was crowded so you don’t think.
So you don’t think anyone saw you making out with her.
‘Mm’.
Right. So on 18th Jan 2020.
You left the club at about 4.45am to 5am.
So you friend Nazarik drove Amanda and you to your house, Nazarik ‘ah’ dropped you off and left as you were heavily drunk you requested for her assistance. Amanda brought you up to your unit, you remember offering her plain water with ice. Then you sat on the black sofa and listen to music under the influence of alcohol ‘ah’ and the what happened at the club you thought you can make out again, so you because you were sexually aroused you started kissing and then ‘ah’ sometime she stopped
And sometime she kissed you back. So you carry on to ‘ah’ you carried her to the bedroom thinking that you could make out again. So you put her on the bed then you slid your finger into her panty and then finger her using two fingers on your right hand. She was sometimes kissing you and sometimes ‘ah’ pushing your hand away. She said No then you stopped.  Then you went back to the hall and then two of you sat ‘ah’ on the so at the other sofa. So you tried kissing her again and then she said
Please stop. You remember fingering her too so when you came to your senses you realise it was wrong then you apologise and she was sobbing. So you told her that ‘ah’ to wash her face and she…

Then she left your house, you, you ‘ah’ said that ‘ah’ you were wrong because you are married and then you should res… you should have respected her and stopped trying when she said no.

‘Mm’
Because ‘ya’ because I need
Did you request?
Naz I believe ‘uh’ Nazrik … Nazrik said like, “‘Eh’ help him. Help him up to his house.” Then I, I also believe probably because of the Thursday conversation when I said, “‘Eh’ if I ‘rabak’, you need to help me.’
‘Mm’

‘Uh’ ‘uh’ for me, personally, I wanted to relax first. I wanted to relax because I cannot go to shower first. So I need to relax and I need to play songs. ‘Ya’. And then I invited her in because she helped me up, and the least, I believe, I could do was to offer her a drink. ‘Ya’, that’s it.
‘Mm’ OK, so she sat on the same sofa as you?
‘Yeah’
All right. Then after that, what happened?
Then after that ‘uh’ I believe because she was sitting here; I was sitting at the back. Then she was leaning here. Then I kissed her cheek. Then I kissed her lips. And she kissed me. Then after that ‘uh’ she turned. Like she turned. Then on top of me. And then I carried her to the bedroom.

The whole? That means the whole … you lifted the whole body?
‘Ah’
OK.
‘Ya’ then after that, ‘uh’ she laid down on the bed. Then after that she kissed. So there were times when that’s the point when … there were times she kissed, there were times she stopped.
Stopped, meaning how?
She didn’t want to kiss.
Like how did she indicate that she doesn’t want to kiss you?
She just like … she just stopped kissing.
OK.
‘Ah’ then after that. ‘Uh’ when I kissed, then she kissed back.

‘Mm’
‘Ya’ then after that ‘uh’ I believe I fingered her.
‘Mm’

OK.
Then after that when she asked me to stop, I stopped. Then after that, we went back to the hall. Then after that ‘uh’
Wait, wait. How did she ask you to stop?
‘Uh’ “Please stop”
She said it? She said it explicitly, is it?
Like, “stop”.
Did she do anything to stop you?
She … can’t remember about that. But, you know, her hands was … hand was like pushing my hand away.
‘Mm’
‘Mm’ Then stop. Then …
OK
… after that I stopped. Then we went to the hall.
That, ‘uh’, wait, ‘ah’. Sorry. Let me try to … gather my thoughts. ‘Uh’ OK. So that means she actually pushed your hand away?
Like … like that, ‘ya’?
When you are already fingering her?
‘Mm hm’
And that was like ‘uhm’ already halfway fingering? Or you just started fingering? Or how, how?
Halfway fingering.
Do you remember like for how long have you been fingering her? Then she try to push your … put your hand away?
‘Uh’ I don’t remember but I know it was it’s been, it’s been there quite for quite some times, ‘ah’.
‘Oh’ OK.

‘Uh’ ‘ya’.
OK
‘Mm’
So what about her clothing? Did you, ‘uh’? What did you do …?
I didn’t undress. I didn’t undress her.
Did you try?
No.
What about you?

OK.
Because I had no intention to … I believe, I had no intention … intention to do anything more beyond that.
‘Uh huh’
Like to rape her, or to have sex with her. No.
‘Mm’
Because that, that was my intention ‘ah’.
Why did she say rape? Was she, was she not consenting? To your actions?
OK. Probably I rephrase it a bit.
‘Mm hm’
I … can I rephrase it?
Sure.
So I had no intention to, to have sex with her.
OK.
Basically. ‘Ya’. So that’s why I didn’t, I didn’t remove any of our clothings.
OK, so by fingering her, what did you, like ‘uh’, what was your aim, actually? Did they, you know …?
I was … you know I was just ‘uh’ I was influenced by alcohol. I was just ‘uh’ sexually aroused. That’s it.
OK.
‘Mm’
So were you expecting anything from her?
No. Meaning?
Meaning that like you know you fingered her. Were you expecting anything in return?
Like ‘uh’ because we had that moment in the club, thinking that it, thinking that she will, she will reciprocate, ‘ah’. So when she stopped, she told me to stop. That’s when I stopped.
Reciprocate, meaning?
Like …
How?
…she kissed me vigorously. She … it was a 2-way thing in the club.
‘Mm hm’
‘Ya’, so I thought it’ll be the same.

OK
‘Ya’ Then after that, …
That means she’s closer to the TV, or you’re closer to the TV?
She was closer to the TV. So it’s like, I’m here, she’s here.
Face to face?
Like, she was there. Then after that, she turned.
OK.
‘Ya’. Then after that, we kissed again. Then after that, ‘uh’ …
Did she say anything about the incident in the bedroom? Or did she like ‘uh’ did she do anything or say anything ‘uh’ to like show her emotions regarding what happened in the, in the room?
‘Uhm’ I don’t … I don’t remember witnessing that. But I believe there isn’t any.
OK.
‘Ya’.
‘Ya’ So you started kissing again?
Kissing again, then I tried to finger again. It went inside like … went inside the panties. But then she … she said, “Please stop.” Then I stopped. Then that’s when she said. The 2nd time when she said “Please stop” that’s when I came to my senses.
You mean 2nd time meaning …?
The 2nd time in, at the sofa, ‘la’. So the 1st time
The 1st time in the bedroom?
Inside
OK
So I came to my senses. And I realised that it was wrong. I don’t understand what’s fricking wrong. It was ultimately wrong. And immediately I felt so guilty towards her. Felt so remorseful towards her. I apologised continuously. Then I told her to … then after that, I saw her like she was sobbing. I said, “I’m really, really sorry. I know, I shouldn’t have done this. I should have respected you. I’m really sorry. I … I’m really, really sorry.” And I … turned to wash her face, ‘la’. But I stayed in the hotel, I mean, in the hall. I didn’t follow her.
So when she came back, I offered her … I think I offered her tissue. I offered a box of tissue. And said, “I’m really, really sorry. I’m like … Please forgive me.”
Then she said, “OK. I want to go home.” Then I said OK.
You let her go herself, ‘ah’?
Yes.
OK. ‘Uh’ you said that you put your finger inside her panty, right?
‘Mm’
That means, the 2nd time on the sofa?
‘Mm’
‘Uh’ did your fingers penetrate her vagina?
I can’t remember the 2nd one. I remember the 1st one.
‘Hm’
‘Hm’
OK. Do you still remember what’s the state of her vagina? Was it lubricated? Was it wet? Was it dry? How was it like?
I … I … based on the 1st one, the touch of it was wet.
1st one, meaning the one in the bed…
Room
…room? OK.
It was wet.
What about the 2nd one?
From outside, it’s still quite wet ‘uh’.
‘Mm’ OK. OK. So you said that ‘uh’ but she started sobbing, right?
‘Mm hm’
Like sobbing loudly?
No, she just like …
Was she crying? Was there any tear?
I don’t … I can’t see ‘ah’ because my eye, because my vision was impaired, ‘la’.
Because of …?
Because of the alcohol, like I cannot see properly. Because I need to wear specs, and that day I didn’t wear any specs.
OK
‘Ya’.
What’s your degree?
300? 300 for both, I think. 350.
OK.
‘Ya’
OK. After that, you said that ‘uh’ she, she. Then you were trying to apologise and all this. ‘Uh’ you said that you felt that it was fricking wrong. Why? Why did you say that?
‘Uh’ like I mentioned in the statement: I’m a married man. A married man, ‘ya’. And, and what I mentioned to her I should have expected her ‘uh’ right from the beginning. You know, like I should have respected her.
OK. OK. Respected her, meaning, respect what?
Respect her as a person. Like, I should not even try to do anything even in the club.
‘Mm hm’
‘Mm’
OK. But if let’s say, like what you say it was consensual, in the club, then why do you think you’re not respecting her?
That was my mistake. I let … I let my desire, my lust control me, ‘la’. Control me in the way that … control me to a certain extent, but I managed to stop it before it went even worse.
OK. All right. ‘Uhm’ so after she left, right, did you message her? Did she message you?
No, didn’t text her.
Right. When did you delete the message with her?
I deleted the message, like, even before we met. Even before we met at Marquee.
OK.
‘Mm’
So were you ‘uh’ I mean, what, what were you thinking when you …
… deleted her messages?
Nothing. Like …
You said that you don’t want your wife to find out, right?
‘Ya’
Your wife: she, she checks your phone?
‘Mm’ ‘ya’ because she knows my password.
OK.
‘Ya’. She has my facial ID. Facial, right? She has her facial ID at my phone. ‘Ya’.
OK. So …
And, and normally it’s ‘uh’ I usually delete ‘uh’ text, ‘uh’.
‘Oh’ is it the first time that you are, you are actually went out with another girl?
Yes, correct.
OK. Behind your wife’s back? She doesn’t know about this, right?
No
She did, OK, she didn’t know about this until we approached you yesterday, ‘la’?
‘Ya’
OK. So did she know that you were going to clubbing, and all this?
No
You said that you felt wrong because you are a married man. What do you mean?
Like … ‘uhm’ … I wouldn’t be, I wouldn’t feel so bad if I didn’t do anything to any girls in the club. Like I was just drinking. Just friends. But immediately when I came to my senses, everything just flashed back in front of me. And ‘uh’ we are not like ‘tsk’ like ‘uh’ I just thought of my wife  .
‘Uh huh’ OK. Do you have anything else? No? Do you have anything to clarify with me?
‘Uh’ for this case, just want to ask, is it possible to get a lawyer to represent me?
I mean, you can always get a lawyer to represent you. Yes, to send in representatives from the lawyer …
To her?
… but we, we have no issues for that. ‘Uh’ ‘ya’ we can always do that ‘uh’. No issue. OK. I mean, of course we the next best ‘uh’ opportunity, then you can ask for a lawyer, ‘la’. Like, meaning that, if let’s say your wife, if preliminary investigations completed, then we would allow you a lawyer, that kind of thing, right?
Can I say something, also?
Sure
‘Ah’ … I know this may not mean anything to anyone but I really hope that I’m able to be, to be left, to be bailed out so that I can be with my wife. And my mom especially, my wife especially ‘la’. I … I can’t go on any further inside the cell, knowing that my wife is suffering outside. We need … it didn’t do me any good, knowing that she didn’t want to look at me yesterday. I may beg you to let me continue the case.
OK. Then I have a piece of advice for you also. If you don’t want such things to be happening to you, right, to your wife, think before you act, ‘la’? Right? For this case, it’s … it’s not even necessary, right? If you didn’t lie to your wife. You saw it as an opportunity. I know, because your wife was not around. Your mom wasn’t around. So that’s why you lied to her, you went to clubbing, and then you actually hooked up with girls. Right? You should, you could have prevented everything. But you actually took a deliberate act to go and cheat on your wife. You should be fair on yourself. OK?
Yes
Whether bail will be given to you, that one ‘uh’ we’ll consider later and we’ll let your wife know, OK?
If OK let’s say if the bail doesn’t go through, what will be the next step?
We’ll pass you the charge.
Charge, meaning …?
Going to Court.
Then? After that?
Then after that, then it’ll be ‘uh’ it will be a different matter ‘la’. Meaning, the Court will consider whether to give you called bail or you’ll be remanded. That’s a different matter. OK? When it comes to this stage, then, of course, I’ll meet you again. I’ll tell you what’s going to happen. Then you have better picture of ‘ya’ what’s going on. OK? But of course at this point of time the decision is not made yet. OK?
So if everything is OK, then we will stop this interview. So ‘uh’ ‘uh’ ‘ya’ OK?
Like the one you mentioned that I can get a lawyer. How, how do I do, go about …?
Like I said, ‘uh’ once my preliminary investigation is, is finished, I will allow you to call your wife to discuss on how to engage a lawyer. And she can go and look for you, ‘la’. Basically. Or if you have, already have a lawyer, then we can let you call the lawyer. OK?
Is there anything else before we end the interview?
By when do I know that if I will get the bail?
later on. Right?
OK
Anything else? Nope. OK, I’ll end the interview now.

‘Uh’ yes Sir.
And can I also confirm that your preferred language would be English?
‘Uh’ yes Sir.
OK. So as I was mentioning earlier, ‘uh’ I’m investigating into a case of Sexual Assault by Penetration. ‘Uhm’ I understand that you had been… you, you have been under investigation by Bedok Police Division…
Yes Sir.
…for a number of things. Today’s interview is just going to touch on 1 of the components. OK? Which is in relation to 1 female Malay ‘uhm’ 18 years old back then ‘la’, ‘uh’ at the time of the incident. ‘Uhm’ do you remember that while you were under investigation…
…you have given a few statements to the Police?
Yes Sir.
OK I’m going to ‘uh’ bring you through these statements that you have given previously but I will concentrate on what’s relevant to today.
OK Sir.
OK? But you just confirm whether this is statement that you gave voluntarily and you confirm that this is the statement that you gave. OK?
OK.
OK. So there was this statement that was given on the 13th of September 2020 to 1 inspector Ong Wei Xiang, Bryan at Bedok Police Division. ‘Uh’ statement was recorded at 12.38am on the 13th of September 2020. You can see. Can you see?
‘Ya’.
Can you confirm that this statement was given by you and given voluntarily?
Yes Sir.
Do you need me to read through the statement to help you remember?
‘Uh’ ‘uh’ I’ve… may, maybe just a summary ‘la’. Just a summary.
‘Uh’ ‘uh’ never mind. I tell you what. I’ll just quickly run through, then after that I’ll tell you ‘uh’…
I’ll ask clarifications in relation to the relevant part ‘la’, OK? So this first statement that was… that you gave on the 13th of September 2020, you mentioned that you are… “I am known as Chin to my friends and my family and am currently residing at Block 936, Tampines Avenue 5, 09 dash 109 with my family. I am currently working as an Engineer in SAF.”
“My part-time hobby is photography which I started about 3 to 4 years ago. I used to take my photos of scenery and objects but I recently started trying to take photos of people. I try taking photos of people who look normal, not too much make up and look natural. On the 12th of September 2020 at about 1pm, I was leaving my apartment and was walking along the void deck towards the bus stop of Block 938 Tampines. I had to cross an overhead bridge and was walking up the stairs when I came across a young, normal looking girl…
…wearing black who was walking down the stairs. She fit the profile of the type of people I wanted to take photos of. So I walked down the stairs to follow her for a short distance to Block 938 Tampines. I then asked her if she would be interested in a photoshoot so I could practice my photography skills. She then asked me when and I told her we could plan something out and I could contact her. She then agreed and gave me her contact number 88755065, and her name was Eliza. I then told her if she was not comfortable…”
…with my approach, you will tell me. However, she was very quiet and I could not hear her. I then told her that she can text and  … thereafter. I texted her later on, later on and introduced myself that I was learning photography and told… I was looking for people to practise on. I asked if she took photos and if she liked taking photos to which she said yes.  I asked her when she was free and she told me that she had school on weekdays.
I asked how old she was and what school. And she told me she was 11 and went to Red Swastika School. I then told her that I will see how it goes and did not contact her afterwards. I will like to add that I had engaged other people before on the streets and asked them if they would be interested in taking part in my photoshoot. And that if they weren’t comfortable, it’s OK. I had no intention to pursue anything romantic with the  …
I admit that I had numerous photos of girls in my phone and that I screenshot from Instagram and other pages. I do not know these girls and it’s purely for my own consumption and it is separate from my intentions when I spoke to Eliz. I had no ill intention of speaking to Eliz and I admit that I should be more careful in future when approaching others. You confirm that this statement was given by you and voluntarily?
‘Yup’.
OK. So this statement direct  … Relevant part for me, for my case is the other girls. OK?
OK.
So Eliz is a separate investigation that’s conducted by Bedok Police Division.
So you went on to give a further statement on the 28th. ‘Uhm’ sorry. On the 13th of September 2020 at 7.16pm.
‘Mm’.
OK? I’m not going to go through the whole…
‘Ya’ it’s OK.
…of this statement but I will just bring you to the relevant part. Read it back to you.
Then you tell me…
…whether it’s accurate.
OK.
OK? And ‘uh’ I also noticed that this para… the statement is not paragraphed. In any case, 13th September 2020, 7.16pm statement, page 3, the last paragraph. You mentioned that “For the 18 year old girl, she was mostly comfortable with the photoshoot and attire to wear. I did about 2 to 3 shoots with her and at the last shoot, we did a nude shoot which she suggested it.  At one point, I started kissing her. She didn’t say anything and told me she doesn’t want to.”
Later on in the shoot, I also tried to finger her by act of digitally penetrating her vagina with my fingers. However, she appeared to be uncomfortable but I thought she was being shy. After trying it for a few seconds more, I realised that she was uncomfortable and not shy. So I stopped. That was the last shoot we had.You confirm that this statement relating to the 18 year old girl was given by you voluntarily?
‘Uh’ yes Sir.
And it’s…
‘Uh’ it’s… ‘uh’ sorry you were saying?
And is it accurate…
‘Uhm’  …
…as to what you have mentioned?
‘Uh’ more or less.
More or less.
‘Ya’.
‘Ya’ OK ‘ah’? And you were not forced to give this statement right?
‘Uh’ no but I just ‘uh’…
…I was just being honest about what happened.
OK, ‘ya’. That’s, that’s what we want ‘la’.
‘Ya’.
For you to be honest about what happened ‘la’.
But, but Sir I think I just want to add ‘uh’…
‘Ya’. You give, give me a moment. I will come to you. ‘Uh’ ‘ya’ I will run through this thing with you again. OK?
…
You got that??
Give me a moment ‘ah’.
OK. So after that, there was another video recorded interview similar to this setting ‘ah’ that was carried out on the 14th of September 2020.
‘Uh’ I will bring you straight to the part ‘la’ where…
…they talked about the 18 year old ‘la’.
‘Ya’.
‘Uh’ see this highlighted portion? It meant… it met… it states here first photoshoot bikini, swimsuit, NTU Graduate Hall 1. 18 year old with her boyfriend. Second shoot, similar shoot, nothing happened. Third shoot, similar wear, thought that 18 year old fingered her, comfort… uncomfortable. Fingered twice, rejected. Count photoshoot, not ending. I, I do not know. It’s a, it’s a summary.
I…
Do you remember what you told the IO?
I didn’t say count. ‘Uh’ wh… I think what happened was we stopped there and then. And as in, just apologised and stopped there. That is what I  …
OK.
OK so I’m going to move on to my interview. OK? In relation to the 18 year old. You ready?
OK.  … Give me a while.
OK.
Done ‘ah’?
‘Mm’.
OK. So for, for tidiness ‘ah’, can you tell me when did you pick up this habit of photography?
‘Uh’ it’s about 2016, 2017. About there.
OK. OK.
Or… ‘ya’. Can’t remember but it was quite some time back.
OK.
‘Ya’.
And, and how do you go about finding models for your photoshoot?
‘Uh’ sometimes I have friends, sometimes I just go on the street and I just see people who look good then I just talk to them.
Approach random people on the streets?
‘Yup’.
Do you put up any online ads or any others?
‘Uh’ I did for a period of time. ‘Ya’ back then.
And which  …
But it was… ‘uhm’ back in 2018 or so and then after that I did 1 more in 2020.
‘Mm hm’.
But the 2020 one was ‘uh’ more for like… is like more for fun. Like I wasn’t really going to do a shoot. Because ‘uh’ there was COVID measures and stuff and I, and I was quite busy. And furthermore it was not ‘uhm’ to really do a shoot. I was just curious about how people ‘uh’ respond to the ads. In terms of like amount and, and… ‘ya’.
So, so where did you… what, what… which platform did you put your advertisement on?
‘Uh’ I put it on Locanto.
So… at what?
Locanto.
‘Ya’. And back then it was Gumtree. ‘Ya’.
OK.
‘Ya’ but ‘uh’ have not… cont… never… have not done so since last year. ‘Ya’.
You, you need to speak up ‘ah’.
‘Ya’.
OK.
You, you… because you start loud and then start to…
OK. Sorry.
…go down. ‘Uh’ OK so in, in totality ‘ah’, how many people actually responded to your ads?
‘Uh’ ‘wa’ I, I can’t remember the exact number.
‘Mm hm’.
‘Uh’ because some of them just reply but they never turn up after that.
OK.
‘Uh’ then some people is like just didn’t feel comfortable.
‘Uhm’ I would say around…
Speak louder.
A, around there should be about maybe 10 or so. I, I really can’t remember now.
10 or so people responded?
‘Ya’.
But how many people did you actually engage to… for the photoshoot?
‘Uhm’ one was the 18 year old.
‘Mm hm’.
‘Uhm’ the other one was ‘uh’ this 40 over year old ‘uh’…
40 year old?
‘Ya’.
OK.
Fort… 40... I, I don’t know what’s the age, ‘ya’.
OK.
‘Yup’.
And?
And ‘uh’… that, that’s all. ‘Ya’.
There was a 15 year old girl?
‘Ya’ the 15 year old one…
Not through ad ‘la’?
Not through ads. Just ‘uh’ just met outside.
OK. You don’t…
‘Yup’.
…try, try not to mumble ‘la’.
OK.
We won’t be able to capture what you are saying.
Sorry my throat is really rough. ‘Ya’.
Do you need water?
‘Uh’.
You want water, I can quickly run up and pick, pick up water.
It’s OK. I’ll just…
OK I’ll just get you a water.
OK can ‘la’, thank you.
Thank you so much.
OK.
‘Yup’.
OK so, so basically in summary, that’s how you operate ‘la’. So this particular 18 year old, do you know what’s her name?
‘Uh’ I don’t know her full name.
‘Mm hm’.
‘Uh’ but I call her by Heed I think. H, E, E, D.
H, E, D ‘ah’?
E, E, D.
H, E, E, D ‘ah’?
‘Ya’.
Why, why?
That was how she told me to address her. ‘Ya’. As in…
H, E?
‘Ya’.
H, E, E, D. OK. And, and how was the acquaintance like? I mean who contacted who?
‘Uh’ she contacted me first back then.
Mm hm’.
‘Uhm’ then we had some ‘uh’ made… we made some arrangements.
OK.
‘Ya’ then it was quite ‘uh’ friendly.
Louder.
It was quite friendly across the whole… the, the few sessions that we had ‘la’. ‘Ya’.
What do you mean friendly?
‘Uhm’ she was ‘uh’ she was quite a good model.
OK.
And she was also quite ‘uh’ OK ‘uhm’… she was just… I think we had some form of chemistry ‘ah’. Like in terms of like ‘uh’ the partnership. Like it was quite OK ‘la’.
‘Mm’.
There wasn’t like a lot to… like it wasn’t, it wasn’t very awkward. We could ‘uh’ just get nice photos out ‘la’.
OK.
‘Ya’.
And what was the deal?
‘Uhm’.
How much did you pay her?
I paid her about I think average say about 50 an hour.
OK.
So we did usually about 2 to 3 hours ‘uh’ kind of shoots. ‘Ya’. ‘Ya’. Sometimes a bit more, sometimes… I can’t remember exactly.
OK.
But it’s around 50 ‘la’. ‘Ya’.
Right. So there were how many total… how many meet ups were there in total?
For this girl, we met up 3 times.
OK. Tell me. Let’s go one…
…thing at a time. OK?
‘Mm’.
OK?
‘Mm’.
Tell me about the first meeting. Do you know exactly when was it?
I can’t remember the date.
‘Mm hm’.
I only remember the year.
OK.
It’s in 2018.
2018.
It was... every, everything was in 2018, 2018. ‘Ya’. ‘Uhm’. OK what, what else about…
‘Ya’ so, so tell me ‘la’, how, how did she… how did… how did you all communicate…
OK.
…how did she come at… to your place, where did you all meet up, that kind of things ‘la’.
‘Uh’ we met up ‘uh’ straight at my… where I, where I stayed. The hostel. As in she came directly.
NTU?
‘Ya’.
You were studying back then?
Yes, I was studying part-time. ‘Ya’.
You studying part-time and you stay in a hos, hos…
‘Uh’ yes correct. ‘Ya’.
OK.
‘Ya’. Because I stay in Tampines, very far for me to get to work. ‘Ya’ and to study at the same time.
You were working ‘ah’ back then?
‘Ya’.
You are already in SAF already?
‘Ya’.
OK.
‘Uhm’ so she went up to my hostel, then she, she came up.
She came alone?
‘Uh’ she came with a guy. I think is the boyfriend. Not sure. I think so. ‘Uh’ and then ‘uh’ they just stayed in the room while I do the photoshoot.
‘Uh’ describe, describe. Give me details ‘la’.
‘Uh’.
I wasn’t there. You need to describe to me…
OK.
…what actually… so she arrived…
‘Yup’.
So she… you all… I suppose you all communicated by some form of…
‘Uh’ I think initially was through the app itself.
OK.
Thereafter then we exchanged numbers.
OK.
‘Ya’ but I can’t remember when  … Exchange numbers.
It’s OK, fine. So… but, but the thing is you all make an arrangement for her to come down. You… did you go and fetch her or she came on her own?
No ‘uh’ she… we met at the bus stop.
OK.
‘Ya’.
And then she was with this guy?
… ‘Uh’ yes if I…  … that’s correct.
Did she introduce who this guy was?
‘Uhm’ not really. It was…
So who do you think this guy was?
I just thought it was either the brother or the boyfriend ‘la’. Either one ‘la’.
OK.
But I think it’s the boyfriend ‘la’. ‘Ya’. I’m not sure.
You… OK when… your photoshoot had skimpy clothing and all that right?
‘Ya’  …
Why would her brother want to follow her for a… this kind of photoshoot?
‘Orh’, ‘ya’.
I mean it’s just my guess ‘la’ ‘ah’. But anyway you… the guy, did he introduce himself to you?
No.
No. OK. So you all went up to your room. Which floor is your room?
‘Uh’ 3rd floor.
Give me the address of the hostel.
‘Uh’ it was Graduate Hall 1.
‘Mm hm’.
‘Uh’ if I’m not wrong, the number is 3-16. I can’t remember the, the room number but is level 3, room 16 if I’m not wrong.
OK. And you are staying alone?
‘Ya’ staying alone.
OK.
So I… ‘ya’ I, I had the room ‘uh’ just set up basically. ‘Uh’ I used the curtains as a backdrop, as 1 of the, the background. And I also used the wall as another background. ‘Ya’ at primarily at these 2 areas, ‘uhm’ plus a bit of the, the bed because it’s white and it’s clean. Clear, it’s easier to put lights on it to, to take nice photo ‘la’. So that’s how I set up the, the photography  …
And the guy was waiting throughout?
The guy was sitting at the… near the door area.
Throughout the whole session?
Yes, throughout the whole sess…
How long was this session in the first time?
‘Uh’ I think it was 2 hours, about there. I  …
So, so the guy actually witnesses the whole photoshoot ‘la’?
Yes ‘uh’ after that, after a while he was just playing his phone there.
OK.
‘Ya’ ‘uhm’, ‘ya’.  …
Then how about the attires?
‘Uh’.
Attire she wore for the photoshoot.
So she… ‘uh’ mostly ‘uh’ was provided by me. ‘Uh’ because I just wanted ‘uh’ some, some nice photos ‘la’ with my own ‘uh’ standards ‘la’ so I gave her most of the attire. I don’t think she brought any… I, I can’t remember. Perhaps a jacket she brought or something. Like to go along with the shoot. So we did in and out, swap out with that jacket together with the, with the bikini and stuff ‘la’. So it’s like a mix.
OK.
‘Uhm’ along the way ‘uhm’ there were some awkward moments because the clothes started to move and stuff. So ‘uh’ she didn’t know. In fact, I, I told her about it. Like “‘eh’ you need to adjust a bit.” ‘Uh’ and it was a bit awkward but I felt that…
Explain. Don’t, don’t, don’t…
‘Ya’.
…be vague about your answers. What do you mean awkward moments? What, what was exposed?
‘Uh’ her top part was exposed.
What top part?
Just her upper body.
Use the actual words. Use the actual word.
‘Uhm’ the, the bikini just slipped off the, the breast. ‘Ya’.
The breast ‘la’.
‘Ya’.
So what was exposed?
‘Uhm’.
Nipples? Or just part of the breast?
‘Uh’ her nipples were exposed. So I…
‘Ah’ so just, just speak plainly ‘ah’. Please don’t, don’t choose words.
Sorry it’s just awkward to…
Nothing, nothing awkward. You need to speak the truth what.
‘Ya’.
You said you want to speak the truth. Correct or not?
‘Ya’.
So just speak the truth.
‘Ya’.
There’s nothing to be awkward about.
So, so ‘ya’ I did tell her a few times. Becasuse it happened more than once. To, to just readjust ‘la’.
OK.
‘Ya’. And ‘uh’ fortunately it was OK because we still managed to, to go on with the shoots. She just ‘uh’ laughed about it and then she just put it back. ‘Uh’ put the, the, the cloth back on so that it covers properly ‘la’.
OK.
‘Ya’. So ‘uh’ that was the first shoot in general.
OK. So what… how was her demeanour like throughout the photoshoot?
How was the?
Demeanour. How was her mannerism or behaviour?
She was…
Was she like uncomfortable when she  … For you.
No she was shy and ‘uh’ friendly. She was very friendly. ‘Uh’ she was ‘uhm’ she seems quite experienced.
It’s like it’s not her first time.
‘Mm hm’.
‘Uh’ in fact it’s not her first time I think. She sent me some of her previous ‘uh’ photoshoots which were similar settings as well. Then ‘uh’ ‘ya’ she was, she was quite cheerful and ‘uh’ ‘ya’ she was a bit ‘uh’ sh… she was a bit shy or awkward but then she quickly just adjust back and we just carry on.  … So it was quite a… it, it was quite a good ‘uh’ ‘uh’ partnership.
OK so how did that ‘uh’ first day end?
‘Uhm’ it just ended ‘uh’ ‘ya’ as in… it just, it just… when we finished everything about time, and it’s like about 2, 3 hours, we are, we are quite tired and stuff because it’s been back to back.
‘Mm hm’.
‘Uh’ and then we just… I just passed her the money and then we just left from there.
Left ‘la’?
Yes, correct. And then I think I walked them to the bus stop because it’s not so easy to walk…
How about the photos that you took? Does she get a copy?
Yes, I send to her as well after I ‘uh’ adjust the colour for them. And then I…
Send by?
‘Uh’ either through WhatsApp or through email. I can’t really remember. ‘Ya’. Because… ‘ya’, I, I, I can’t remember. But I sent them in like batches because I need time to, to adjust them.
OK.
‘Ya’.
OK. So that was first time.
‘Yup’.
And ‘uh’ how many clothes change did she have for the first time?
‘Wa’ I can’t remember ‘eh’. I think about 5. Because we spent about 20 to 30 minutes. About… ‘ya’.
Each time she need to do a change of clothes, where does she do it?
‘Uh’ she change in the toilet. There’s a toilet in the room.
In your room there’s a toilet.
‘Ya’.
OK. So first day was just like that ‘la’? Nothing else ‘ah’?
Yes. Nothing else.
OK. When was the second meet up? How long after the first?
I think it was about 3, 3 to 4 weeks. I really can’t remember.
OK.
But it’s, it’s a, a window because I haven’t finished my first batch…
‘Mm hm’.
…of edits and stuff. ‘Ya’ and then after that we met up again.
You, you called her? Or she called you?
‘Uhm’ I, I really can’t remember but ‘uhm’ it just felt like that day we were not done yet, you know. Like we were done but we, we can’t go on anymore because there’s only so much we can do in a day to get nice photos ‘la’.
‘Mm hm’.
‘Ya’ she had ‘uhm’ a bit of eye bags as well, I remember. So I told her “you look a bit tired and it, it doesn’t really look nice on the photos and I have to adjust. I have to put in more effort to adjust it out and it’s just… ‘ya’.”
OK.
A lot of effort on me ‘ah’ so I didn’t really… I told her that maybe we try again next time. Then we link up again ‘la’.
So the next time took place about 3 to 4 weeks later.
‘Ya’.
‘Uh’ you do not remember who called who ‘la’?
I, I really can’t remember. Because it’s really…
Then let’s talk about her arrival. She came or you went to fetch her?
‘Uh’ I… OK I can’t remember which way was it. Because I only remember that 1 of the shoot, when it’s done right, I actually sent her out all the way to ‘uh’ Boon Lay MRT.
OK.
And it’s like… I can’t remember whether was it picking her or was it sending her out. ‘Ya’ but 1 of them, I actually sent her quite far away ‘la’ and we had a small conversation ‘la’.
And do you remember which one?
I really can’t rem… it’s definitely not the last one. ‘Uhm’ ‘oh’ wait. ‘Ya’ it’s definitely not the last one. I think, I think is the second one.
OK.
‘Ya’. So I, I can’t remember whether was it receiving her or was it sending her off.
So never mind, so she, so she came to your room?
Yes.
OK. How long was she there?
‘Uh’ it’s a similar timeframe. About…
Was she alone?
Yes, she’s alone this time.
OK. Tell me about the photoshoots.
‘Uhm’ this one I think it went like the normal, as per the last round. Then along the way, I think she actually seems quite comfortable with ‘uh’ not… because it cont… it’s still happening. The, the slipping. And then ‘uh’ I actually asked her if she wants to try…
The slipping, just for the record, slipping you are referring to the nipples slipping…
‘Ya’.
…out of the clothing is it?
‘Ya’.
OK.
So I just wanted to ask her whether you wanted to just not wear it ‘la’. I mean if you, if you want, you can try something different ‘la’. So ‘uhm’ then she was OK with it.
So you all did a nude photoshoot?
‘Ya’. I think it was the second one onwards if I’m not wrong. We tried some in the second, we tried some in the third. I, I can’t remember now. But ‘ya’ so basically ‘uhm’ she was OK and then we just started ‘uh’ doing some of those ‘uh’ shoots ‘la’ and…
Nude as in total nude or partial nude?
We started with partial, then after that she went all.
So when you said partial nude, means what? What… which part is covered?
‘Uh’ the bottom is covered.
OK.
‘Ya’. Then ‘uhm’…
…‘ya’ that, that was… and she, she, she seems quite OK. In fact, throughout, throughout the whole shoot. And the photos, the photos turned out very, very nice. ‘Uh’ in terms of the colour. ‘Uh’ I mean I agree that the… it, it, it’s a bit sensitive. I mean that… the areas that were shot because it’s not… ‘uh’ it’s nude. ‘Uhm’ but the, the photos turned out good in terms of the colours. ‘Ya’.
OK.
So…
So was there any contact between you and her? Physical contact.
‘Uh’ not in the second shoot. ‘Ya’.
So OK, so there’s no physical contact…
‘Ya’.
…between you and her, she’s OK with nudity.
‘Ya’.
And you said her demeanour was shy but friendly at the same time. Did she joke with you?
‘Uhm’ not really joke I would say. Maybe just like ‘uhm’…
…awkward laughs.  … You know…
Was there any sexualised communications?
No.
No ‘ah’?
‘Ya’, no.
So how did that day end?
‘Uh’ if I’m not wrong, because it was quite a pleasant engagement that day, I sent her out all the way to the, to the train station. ‘Uhm’ I think I did ‘uh’ took a… like a selfie with her at the, at the, at the, at the, at the ‘uh’ MRT station. Near the MRT station.
OK.
‘Uh’ I just told her she was quite a, a nice girl to, to, to be hanging out with ‘la’.
‘Mm’.
As in I think at that point of time, there was some form of like ‘uhm’… I, I don’t know, maybe it’s a miscomm or something but ‘uh’ she was a bit awkward also and she just ‘uh’ laughed about it.
What? About what?
About me just saying that she’s a nice person.
‘Orh’ just that ‘la’?
‘Ya’.
Did she make, make any other comment?
‘Uh’ no. But I did ask her to take a selfie, she was like ‘oh’ ‘uhm’… she’s a bit, she’s a bit shocked ‘la’. Like why do you need to do that ‘la’.
Take a…
As in she, she, she’s…
She’s shocked to take a wefie with you?
As in she’s just surprised that ‘uh’…
You want to take…
Yes. ‘Ya’. I mean she was OK with it. She just ‘uh’ didn’t see that ‘uh’… ‘ya’. Then ‘uh’ so, so that, that, that’s what I meant by maybe there might be some ‘uhm’ miscomm between us. Like we just didn’t read… I didn’t read her, her, her body language or intentions, or my intentions across to her also were not clear ‘la’.
‘Mm hm’. OK so day 2 done ‘ah’.
‘Ya’.
And when was the third meet up?
‘Uh’ it’s also not that… very far away I think.
‘Mm hm’.
The most maybe another 1 and a half months or so.
OK.
I, I, I really can’t recall now. ‘Uhm’.
Wait ‘ah’. Are you OK?
‘Mm’.
Anything to ask?
No.
OK. Continue.
‘Ya’. The third meet up, ‘uh’ it’s a similar way. She arrived ‘uh’ at the bus stop this time ‘uh’ and I just bring her up to do the shoot. And…
OK. She came alone?
She came alone.  …
Tell me about the photoshoot.
Sorry?
Tell me about the shoot.
‘Uh’ the shoot is pretty much very similar to the last time. ‘Uh’…
Nudity?
‘Ya’ correct. As, as in we… a mix. A mix, ‘ya’.
OK.
And then ‘uhm’ I mean along the way, ‘uh’ I thought that ‘uh’ she ‘uh’… I mean I misread the, the body language ‘la’. I thought that she might ‘uh’ you know, have some liking as well for each other. So I thought I ‘uh’ tried to ‘uhm’ just like get into some ‘uh’ feelings with her ‘la’. Like, like through, through touching her. So that’s when I, I, I, I went into that ‘uh’…
Elaborate. Elaborate for me. Describe.
‘Ya’. ‘Uh’ I just ‘uh’…
What was happening before you…
‘Uh’ we were taking photos.
…misread her? ‘Ya’ ‘la’ I mean obviously.
‘Ya’ ‘uhm’ as in…
What kind of photoshoot was going on?
‘Uh’ it was a half… sem… half nude if I’m not wrong. Partial. ‘Ya’.
OK. Was there any bondage involved?
‘Uh’ is not… ‘uh’ ‘ya’ there were a little bit ‘la’. Because if you just…
Explain ‘la’.
‘Ya’.
So…
‘Uh’ I put on the, the, the straps on. So that it ‘uh’ just add some effects to the photoshoot ‘la’. And then after that ‘uh’ during that point of time, ‘uh’ I just felt like ‘uh’ there was some like connection.
Wait, wait. Don’t, don’t jump.
‘Mm’.
‘Ya’.
So you put on some straps. I’m talking about the bondage photoshoot.
‘Ya’.
So it’s… so it started with normal? Clothing? No clothing?
‘Uh’ I…
Day 3. Day 3 ‘ah’.
‘Ya’. I think there was some. We started with clothing. I, I, I can’t remember.
OK never mind.
‘Ya’.
So, so I don’t…
‘Mm’.
…suppose you come in, straight away take off everything…
‘Ya’.
…and then went straight to nudity ‘la’ but, but you would have… will gradually progress right? Am I guessing it right?
Yes, correct.
OK so, so, so you started your photoshoot. At some point in time, you decided to do bondage. Or restrained…
‘Ya’.
…type of shoots. Was it proposed by you or her?
‘Uhm’ I, I, I proposed to her if I…
OK.
…if I didn’t remember wrongly.
And she was OK with it?
‘Uh’ she was OK with it. ‘Ya’.
OK.
Then…
So and then you strapped her to what?
‘Uh’ to the, to the bed. ‘Ya’.
Describe your bed.
‘Uh’ is just a bed and then the straps were below ‘la’. Below the…
Single bed? Double bed?
‘Uh’ it’s a single bed.
OK. Straps were below where?
Below the bed.
Tied to something ‘ah’?
‘Uh’ no it’s just below the bed and then it’s just ‘ya’.
It’s not tied to anything?
‘Uh’ no. ‘Uh’ no, because the…  … No, for example, the is the bed right, the, the strings are just below. As in the straps are below. And then they are just… you know what I mean?  …
‘Orh’. OK so, so it, it’s running across…
‘Ya’.
…under the mattress ‘la’?
‘Ya’ under. Yes.
So there’s… it’s… technically you cannot take it out ‘la’? Correct?
‘Uh’ you can’t. But the...
Because if she’s lying on it then it will, it will be under…
‘Uh’ yes correct.
…under the bed, correct or not?
But the… I did not put like very, very tight ‘la’.  … It’s just to create the effect.  … ‘Ya’.
So, so you strapped her to the bed?
‘Ya’.
And then?
And then ‘uhm’ we took some photos like ‘uh’ from different angles 'lor'. Top down.
What was she wearing when she was being restrained?
I, I can’t remember now. But I, I remember it was partial ‘la’. ‘Ya’. That means she was not wearing the top and… or maybe she was wearing the jacket  … I…
…I really can’t remember. Like this ‘uh’ grey fleece jacket sort of material. I, I really can’t remember.
OK.
I just know that the jacket was…
Was the leg restrained?
I think so as well. ‘Ya’. I, I, I can’t remember. Because she tried a few different… ‘ya’. ‘Uh’.
Then?
To, to see what turns out nice 'lor' photos, we tried different  …
OK stop explaining why. Those keep… stop giving me justifications. I understand you are try, trying out photoshoots.
‘Yup’.
But, but I want to know what is actually unfolding.
OK.
I want to see it. Not, not…
OK.
Not, not hear your reasons. I understand your reasons. OK? So, so hands strapped, legs strapped.
‘Ya’.
Right? And then you are guessing that she was either partially nude…
I recall was partially.
Partially nude. OK.
Yes, correct.
And…so bottom is covered ‘la’ I suppose?
‘Ya’.
OK. So and then you go about your photo taking.
‘Ya’.
OK then?
‘Uh’.
Your misreading. Earlier you mentioning.
Sorry again?
Misreading her intentions.
‘Ya’ so I was ‘uhm’ taking from the different angles and stuff.
‘Ya’.
And along the way, I, I just felt like she was quite comfortable and I also had this like ‘uh’… I kind of like misread her, her, her… I can’t remember was it facial expression or her body language. Like I… so I went on to just try to, to, to kiss her.
OK wait.
‘Ya’.
What do you mean misread? What, what, what, what was it the face… what was it about her face or her reaction that’s giving you this…
‘Uh’ no it’s the usual like the shy and like ‘uhm’ I’m a bit like awkward and… but that’s how we took the last few rounds that were, that were good.
Shy, awkward doesn’t give you… doesn’t give me signal that she wants to take it to the next level what. So what gives you that thinking that she wants to probably willing, open to trying out something more adventurous?
‘Uhm’. I, I don’t know. It’s just a feeling. I can’t describe it out. It’s just… I just see it. Back then, I felt that she was… she seems very comfortable already and she feel… she seems like she’s like ‘uhm’… I, I, I really can’t remember. Like, like it’s just a… it’s just that, that moment, at that point of time, it just occur and that…
OK.
‘Ya’. I, I can’t… I don’t know how to describe it. ‘Ya’.
And then after that?
So I, I, I approached her and then I ‘uh’ tried to give her a kiss to, to just see if it’s a correct feeling that I was thinking that I was seeing. And then ‘uh’ she kind of like ‘uhm’ ‘uh’ avoided it at first.
Where did you kiss her?
‘Uh’ just on the, the face. ‘Ya’. The…
Where? Where?
I, I can’t remember whether was it the, the cheek or the lips. I, I can’t remember. It’s just around the, the face area.
‘Mm’.
‘Ya’.
You… so, so did you manage to kiss her or she avoided it?
I… maybe just, just briefly touch. I, I really can’t recall. ‘Ya’. Then ‘uhm’ at the same time, I just ‘uh’ ‘uh’… because I think if I didn’t remember wrongly, ‘uhm’ I just went down to, to, to put, put my hand ‘uh’ near the vagina area. At around the same time.
While you are kissing her, your hand is at the vagina?
‘Ya’ I was… when I was trying to… ‘ya’ so I just wanted to create the atmosphere ‘la’. As in after I thought that… you know. So I, I went on then after that ‘uh’ I felt that she was not very comfortable. She  …
What do you mean went on? Don’t, don’t…
No, as in…
Stop being vague, Chin Kiat.
No, I mean like…
Chin Kiat, listen, listen. You are… you just want to be vague, you are going to make things very, very complicated because I’m not going to understand you very clearly. I’m not there. You must understand this. I’m hearing it from you. I… I’ve already heard her version. She’s very clear about what happened. Or, or at least I should say that she is clear in describing what happened. Her descriptions are very clear. But yours are not. So if you want to be clear about what happened between you and her, do not mince your words. Just say things as they happened.
Yes Sir, I’m, I’m trying to recall actually.
You can try to recall but you keep saying I… based..Just touch her here, touch her  there. But you are not describing what exactly you are doing. Can you start from s… that part…
OK.
…you kissed her, at the same time, you said your hand went to her vagina.
‘Ya’ correct.
Went to her vagina to do what?
So I was trying to ‘uhm’ put my finger in to, to just see if she’s ‘uh’ like… if she’s, she’s in the… like in the mood or not ‘la’. Like just, just, just  …
… So she’s wearing something right? Below?
Yes I think so. I’m  …
So how did you try to put? Describe that.
‘Uh’ I just push it ‘uh’ aside slightly and I just put my finger there, ‘ya’. So and then after that…
Which finger?
‘Uh’ I think is the right hand.
OK.
I, I can’t remember which finger. Maybe the… either the index or the…
OK so you put it in… you say you put it in right?
‘Uh’ just briefly in only.
‘Ya la’.
I didn’t go all the way in. Just  … Outside.
How briefly?
‘Uh’ I was just rubbing on the outside and just go in a little bit. Like as in just sliding it in a little bit. ‘Ya’. As in maybe, maybe about until here.
1 notch?
About there. ‘Ya’.
So when… so you are rubbing and 1 notch…
‘Ya’.
1 of your finger entered into her vagina…
‘Ya’.
…to the depth of, of perhaps 1 notch?
Yes, around there.
At the same time, you kissed her?
Was trying to kiss her.
You were trying to kiss her…
‘Ya’.
…and then she w… she turned her face?
‘Ya’. And then ‘uh’ I did recall like asking her, if I’m not wrong, like ‘uh’ “Are you OK?” Or what. Then she was like ‘uh’ she’s, she’s… she just turned her head away. And she was like not very comfortable.
She didn’t reply you ‘la’?
‘Uh’ I can’t remember did she say no. But I, I just know that it was not very good ‘la’. Second time, I think she said no. And then…
Second time what happened?
‘Uh’ as in…
You see, again you are jumping. Come on man, tell me properly.
No as in, second time being like I, I tried again ‘la’. Basically I, I, I took my hand away for a while and then I put it back again to try and then…
How long after?
‘Uh’ just very short. About few seconds only apart.
OK so, so you tried to kiss her, your hand is there.
…
Then you put it inside, then she looked uncomfortable, you take it out and then you put it back again?
‘Ya’, ‘ya’ I just ‘uh’ tried again. Put my finger near the area and just like outside ‘uh’ rubbing and then I asked… ‘uh’ I just looked at her again and then after that she said “No.”
OK so this second time that you penetrated her vagina with your finger…
‘Yup’.
…how long was it?
‘Uh’ like a few seconds only. Like 2 or 3…
How deep did you penetrate her vagina?
I was… I can’t remember did I put in the second time or not.
Because it… I know it’s just around there. I… definitely 1 time, yes. But I can’t remember the second time.
OK your earlier statement you said here what. “At one point, I started kissing, she didn’t say anything and later told me she doesn’t want to.” She… you said she literally opened her mouth and said she don’t want to. The kissing. Correct? “Later on in the shoot, I also tried to finger her.”
I…
Wait, wait, wait.
‘Ya’, OK.
You… just now I read this to you and you agreed you know. Chin Kiat.
…
Listen first. So “later on in the shoot I tried to finger her by act of digitally penetrating her vagina with my finger. However, she appeared to be uncomfortable. But I thought she was being shy. After trying it for a few seconds more, I realised she was uncomfortable and not shy. So I stopped. That was the last shoot.” So this second time round what happened?
So this whole thing right…
‘Mm’.
…is actually about within only 5 minutes. A span of 5 minutes.
… OK. Fair.
So I, I don’t think it’s fair to say like it’s really that long. I, I, I didn’t…  …
I didn’t say it’s very long ‘ah’.
And it’s all within the same…
I never said it’s… listen, listen. I never said it’s very long.
‘Ya’, OK.
I’m running through with…
OK.
…you what you gave to the Police previously.
‘Ya’.
You accept that these facts were given by you right? So I’m trying to clarify here. I never say…
‘Mm’.
It could be, it could be 2 seconds you know.
OK.
I just want to know how many times you put your finger inside.
‘Ya’ so I recall was 2 times. About there. I can’t remember whether was it at the same time, as in how far was the gap to the second time. And whether did I go in or not. I really can’t remember now. But I know that I tried twice.
OK.
‘Ya’. That’s the…
First time already she turned her head away, she looked uncomfortable.
‘Ya’.
And then you went on to try again. So means what? You touched her vagina first ‘la’? The second time round.
‘Ya’, correct. And then she’s…
When you say you touched, means it’s your hand on her vagina directly skin on skin? Or was it like over the clothing?
‘Uh’ skin on skin.
Skin on skin. OK. So this second time round, you rubbed her vagina, did you put it in? Your fingers.
I, I really can’t remember. I might have.
OK.
‘Uh’ but it’s really near… just near the en… ‘uh’ the entrance area only.
OK.
‘Ya’.
And then?
And then she, she said “no”. And I could  …
She said “no”? She opened her mouth and said “no” ‘ah’?
‘Ya’ I could feel that she was really quite uncomfortable. And then ‘uh’ because I didn’t put it very tight, the restraints. I think she got out of it already…
OK.
…and then she just told me like ‘uh’ ‘uh’ it’s not, it’s not, it’s not ‘uhm’ it’s not right ‘la’. So I just told her “OK, I’m, I’m sorry about it.” And I apologised to her and then we just stopped the shoot from there.
And then you paid her?
Yes, I paid her.
And then she left?
‘Ya’, correct.
Did you send her out?
‘Uh’ I sent her out to the bus stop.
OK.
‘Ya’ and I, I apologised to her again at the bus stop again. I saw… I told her like ‘uh’ it’s ‘uhm’ sorry to, to like have misread this ‘uh’ thing and I just sorry to offend her ‘la’. Like in this respect. ‘Ya’ as in because she seemed like quite ‘uh’ unhappy about it ‘la’ towards the end. ‘Ya’.
That’s all?
‘Ya’.
That’s all the transaction between you and her ‘ah’?
‘Ya’ that’s all.
Did you communicate with her after this third meeting?
‘Uhm’ not… I might have just… she, she might have asked me for her photos. I can’t remember. Which I just sent it to her. And then…
…‘uh’ I don’t, I don’t recall that I have because I never kept her number after that. Don’t, don’t… I don’t, I don’t recall I sent her. I’m not sure if she received my ad in the next round, in the, the next round when I sent out again. ‘Ya’ so I, I, I can’t remember now. ‘Ya’.
OK. So…
But I, I did not actively like contact her after that.
Stop already ‘la’?
‘Ya’.
Why?
‘Uh’.
Scared is it?
‘Ya’ because I didn’t…
…I didn’t expect to end it like that ‘la’. It was quite a pleasant ‘uh’ working experience throughout un, until the last part where I just ‘uh’ did not, did not clarify before… ‘ya’.
OK ‘uh’ we, we pause for a while. Let me just check in on…
‘Mm’.
Do you have any questions?
OK just for clarity, just now at some time, you said you put it in, you put it in. But can you confirm you put it into where? Just want to clarify.
‘Uh’ as in the… near the vagin… vagina area, I went in a little bit. About…
OK.
…about…
Because at certain stage, you just mentioned “I put it in.” So I just want to clarify.
‘Uh’  … Finger. ‘Ya’.
When you are referring “put it in”, you are referring to put it into her vagina?
‘Ya’ correct.
And it’s your finger ‘la’?
‘Ya’, ‘ya’ finger.  …
Just to clarify ‘ah’, so when, when the photoshoot takes place right, I, I understand that she has change of clothes and she’s in bikini, and sometimes partial nudity and all that. But you as a photographer, are you fully clothed?
Yes.
All the time?
Yes.
So I got a few clarifications I want to make ‘ah’. ‘Uh’ you met this girl 3 times. You already know that she came with a guy on the first time. Second and third time she didn’t come with any guy. What gives you the confidence to want to try your luck with her?
‘Mm’ I, I wouldn’t say it’s confidence but more of like I felt that there was some chemistry ‘la’.
Just her? Or every, everyone of your girls  …
Just her. The, the rest were…
What… what’s so special about her?
‘Uhm’ I don’t know, the photos turned out very, very, very natural.
OK.
‘Ya’. And I don’t, I don’t need to… I don’t feel ‘uh’ frustrated while trying to take a photo. Like do my, my, my photoshoots. Whereas for the 40 year old one, I had very bad experience. ‘Uh’…
40 year old what race?
Chinese.
What, what, what you mean bad experience?
‘Uhm’ she brought shoes and hats and everything. And then she, she stepped all over my, my, my white bedsheet. And she couldn’t like really follow the instructions I told her to. Like to, to pose naturally or to pose this way. And it was a very unpleasant ‘uhm’…
…
…‘ya’, working experience.
How about the 15 year old?
‘Uhm’ the 15 year old one, we just took a few photos and she was already uncomfortable.
OK.
So I also told her like ‘uh’ “if you don’t want, it’s OK. I just don’t want to… you know. I, I’m not, I’m not here to, to force anybody to, to do anything ‘la’.”
‘Mm’.
So I have…
15 year old got nude, nude shots or not?
Don’t have.
40 year old got nude shots or not?
Don’t have.
OK. ‘Uh’ I want to read this part to you ‘ah’.
The further statement that you gave to the Police on the 13th of September 2020 ‘ah’.
OK.
You mentioned in paragraph 2.
“With regards to the 11 year old I met at the void deck at 938 Tampines, I admit that the reason why I approached her is because at first glance, she looked attractive. I had the same intention with all the other girls I approached to do pho… photoshoots for. The reason for approaching them is because I find them attractive and hope to get to know the girls better during the photoshoot in hope that things will advance sexually between me and them.”
“If the opportunity presents itself during the photoshoots, I am willing to go further with them in that I will kiss them, take part in sexual activities like blowjobs and digital penetration of the girl with my fingers and having sex itself.”
I…
You understand or not? What you just… what is… what did you said in your statement.
I think there’s some error  …
“In hopes that things will advance sexually between me and them.” This was the statement given to…
Wait.
…Bryan Ong Wei Xiang.
I think I like to clarify that…
‘Mm’.
…statement. Maybe the first part. Let… we do it part by part. So  …
‘Ya’ anyway I’m not investigating the 11 year old ‘la’. That one the division will do. But I just want to pay attention to this thing. “In hopes that things will advance sexually between me and them.”
No, Sir, I think what I meant was… what I, what I was trying to say was if the girl is interested in me and she would want to do something, then I will not be saying no to them ‘la’. I mean… but I, I do not ask them or neither do I tell them like ‘eh’ you interested or not to like… to do something.
‘Ya’ but do you agree that with the 18 year old Malay girl, you never even asked her then go ahead and…
‘Ya’ but…
…start touching her?
OK but then…
Just because you think she is a willing party.
‘Ya’ but it doesn’t, it doesn’t ‘uh’ doesn’t link up with that statement you see. Because that statement says that I’m going around like just looking for people.
But it was any… in any case, it was a statement that you gave to that IO. So I’m not going to dwell into that statement. I just going to focus on this 18 year old girl.
With this 18 year old girl, at which point did you think you should… you, you could try to advance this to the next level?
Just during the third shoot.
During the third.
‘Ya’.
And you mentioned because she was friendly and she was shy and all that. ‘Ya’?
‘Ya’.
Did anything give you the impression that she was… she would be OK with you doing it?
‘Uhm’ meaning like…
OK what I’m really trying to understand that… you go to a girl, say ‘eh’ you want to be my girlfriend? But before that you need to get some sensing that she has a liking for you. Understand?
‘Ya’.
Do you agree with that? You don’t just go to a random stranger, say I love you, be my girlfriend and then…
‘Uh’ yes, Sir. Of course.
Right?
‘Ya’.
So likewise, if you have a girlfriend, you don’t just straight away go to her, say come let’s have sex. And then there has to be some kind of build-up both ways, right? I mean naturally ‘la’ I… I’m not scientist. But naturally I mean that’s how things work out. So with you and this girl, prior to the touching, was there anything that gives you the inkling that she wants to be intimate with you?
I don’t think there is a direct one. But what I feel is that she’s quite ‘uh’… we are quite comfortable, both of us as a human. Comfortable to each other. OK that’s one. Second thing is over the, the shoots right, the way she was comfortable with herself being ‘uhm’ like nude in front of me. Just… I mean… I, I misread that, that part ‘la’.
‘Ya’ but, but then again, you mentioned earlier, very, very early part of the interview that she was very much like a natural what. Even in the first photoshoot, you, you felt that she is experienced.
‘Ya’.
So if she’s a experienced model exposing herself and not much of a qualms…
OK.
…having some of her private parts shown, obviously to every other photographer, she… I think naturally would not have that much of a reservation ‘la’. But why would that specifically lead you to think…
‘Ya’ so ‘uh’ I feel there was a miscomms between myself and her. More of me.
What, what is the miscomm? I don’t see her communicating with you at all.
…  It was indirect form of communication.
What? What?
Just body, body language in general.
‘Ya’ so what, what is it that she did? You keep saying it’s a comms, miscomms.
‘Ya’.
Comms got to be 2 people. You agree or not?
‘Ya’ agree, agree. So the way she was just… she was very comfortable.
‘Ya’ she’s a model what. She, she will be un…
No she’s…
…will… she will be uncomf… she will be comfortable with every other photographer also.
But she’s not a full-time model.  …
So?
‘Ya’ what.
You only met her 3 times what. So why would you think that it’s towards you only? Or are you just trying your luck? To get lucky?
No. I, I really…
Honestly, let’s be honest.
Yes. I mean I really felt there was something between 2 of us.
‘Ya’ but you see ‘ah’, throughout your whole interview with me today, she doesn’t seem to be talking much. She’s just friendly…
…and shy.
‘Ya’ but if ‘uh’…
Friendly and shy doesn’t equate to want to get intimate with you 'leh'.
I mean if…
I don’t know how that adds up.
‘Ya’ but if, if, if what I read was correct, then we would have gone  …
So ultimately it’s, it’s always about your perception ‘la’. She never give you any signs. Correct or not?
No. She, she did ‘la’. I mean if not I wouldn’t have…
Like what?
Like…
What kind of signs are you referring to?
I… just the way she… she, she’s very, very comfortable. She’s very relaxed.
No.
…
OK. Just trying to explain. She’s feeling relaxed, she’s feeling comfortable doesn’t give you a sign to tell you that I’m OK with you making sexual… I mean intimate advances with, with you.
OK.
So we are asking you what is it that you keep saying that you misread that she’s, she’s, she’s OK with it? OK. We explain to you. By being comfortable and relaxed, doesn’t seem is an indicator to say we are… I’m OK to have… she’s OK to have…
OK.
…intimacy with you. So can you tell us, be specific, what is it that you misread? That you think she’s saying or telling you, OK come let’s be intimate. We are asking you this is specific. Or like what my ‘uh’ ‘uh’ my ‘uhm’…
Colleague.
…like what colleague say, is it because you are trying your luck? Just trying your luck with her?
I mean, I mean let’s, let’s…
‘Ya’.
…let’s keep our thoughts very clear, Chin Kiat. I’m not judging you ‘ah’ please don’t misunderstand me.
‘Ya’.
I just want to be very, very clear about what happened between the 2 of you. Because most part of your interview with me, you have told me that you misread, you misread, you misread. I can totally ac… understand the misreading part. But I just want to know is it just you? Because do you agree with me… let’s just talk about the touching. You touch her 1 time, you touch her 2 time. When you touched her… OK. Other than this touching ‘ah’, were there any other times that you actually touched her to adjust her clothing?
I didn’t touch her at all. I just told her like…
OK ‘ah’ OK.
‘Ya’. But…
So all these other times…
…but, but I did ‘uh’ along the way, I told her and I helped her adjust but I did not touch her.
So…
I moved the cloth…
Clothing. OK.
‘Ya’ just… without touching her.
Correct.
‘Ya’.
She’s OK with that?
She’s OK with that.
Because you are not touching her.
She’s OK… I mean what I understand is that she’s OK. A little bit of exposure here and there, I, I, I suppose she’s… she accepts it ‘la’. I mean based on what she’s wearing and all that. You pointing out to her to go and adjust it herself and you going over to touch the cloth to adjust it for her sounds reasonable. OK. If I were to look at things from the perspective of the girl, I think she would be appreciative that you are actually pointing out to her ‘la’ but, but…
…do you agree with me that the touching of the vagina was the very, very first time there was skin on skin contact between you and her? Up…
OK.
Have or not?
I mean there were other instances we just brush off each other off  …
OK but brushing is not. Deliberately going over to adjust something or touching, this is the first time right?
‘Yup’.
OK. And, and, and there were no prior deliberate touching that would give you the confidence to straight away touch her vagina. Correct?
I mean in a way, I, I, I know what you mean. Like…
‘Ah’.
…because it’s just… at the point of time, I was just… I, I just thought that there, there was some feeling ‘la’. ‘Ya’. It’s on me ‘la’. I mean I, I think…
‘Ya’, ‘ya’, I mean…
‘Ya’ so I, I just… ‘ya’ I, I don’t know how to tell you but it’s just my, my poor judgement. Like I just thought that you know, there was… ‘ya’.
You just thought that she will be OK ‘la’? Am I right to say  …
…
Is that what you are thinking?
It, it seem to me that way ‘la’. Because we have progressed quite a lot over the, the, the few shoots so I… it was a, it was a, it was a bad, bad, bad thing done by me ‘la’. ‘Ya’.
OK. So ultimately, I’m just going to ask you 1 straightforward question. Did she consent to you touching her or did she not consent to you touching her?
‘Uh’.
Or, or rather, penetrating her vagina with your finger.
‘Uh’ we did not talk about it ‘la’ so ‘ya’.
Did she consent or did she not consent?
She, she did not consent.
She did not consent?
Yes Sir.
And it’s… open your mouth and talk louder a bit. Did she or did she not consent?
She did not consent.
OK so this is how you understand it ‘ah’? Am I right?
Yes Sir.
OK. Thank you for your honesty. ‘Ah’ because your story as it goes along, I mean…
Sir but I, I just want to say that I, I have apologised, apologised to her.
‘Mm’.
And I really ‘uhm’ it was, it was just…
‘Mm’.
I did not…
…
‘Ya’. I, I really did not see that ‘uhm’ it was not the… that, that feeling that I got ‘la’. So I, I never did it to anyone else again and I really ‘uhm’… ‘ya’ it’s, it’s, it’s not, it’s not right ‘la’. So I… ‘ya’.
Your… I what? Finish your sentence 'leh'.
No, I, I, I, I apologise to her ‘la’. ‘Ya’. I, I, I was sorry about it. So I, I, I just felt that… I hope that she would… I, I don’t know if she accepted the apology but I just know that she, she was not very comfortable after that. We, we stopped there ‘la’. We did not go anymore. We just wrapped up the shoot.
OK. Any questions for him?
‘Nope’.
OK. I have nothing else for you already. So as I have mentioned earlier, this whole interview was in relation to this girl. And you have given me again another affirmation that the 40 year old you never do anything.
Nothing.
15 year old you never do anything.
Nothing.
Was there any nudity shots with these other 2?
No, Sir.
And then the 11 year old girl, I will just leave it to Bedok to complete the investigation. OK? ‘Uh’ do you have anything else that you want to add in relation to this matter concerning the thirt… 18 year old Malay girl?
‘Uh’ no Sir. But I just want to, to say again. ‘Uh’ I, I, I, I know it was wrong on my end to, to have ‘uh’ to have moved… advanced on her in that sense. ‘Uhm’ ‘ya’ I, I, I just felt that there were… that we had, we had some feelings ‘la’ but is, is on me ‘la’. I mean I, I misread it ‘la’. And I was ‘uh’ truly sorry about it and I apologised to her.
And I stopped the shoot there and then ‘la’. So I, I, I did not ‘uhm’ try anything more on her. So I just hope that ‘uh’ I hope the, the other person accepts my apology if, if, if you all know. I, I not sure. But I… ‘ya’ I’m, I’m sorry about that. ‘Ya’.  …
OK. So nothing else ‘ah’?
No Sir.
Then I will end the interview OK?
Yes Sir.

Bang, you are 54, sorry 58 years old, Bang, so I’m asking
Yes
‘Ah’
What did he say just now?
How long have you been drinking?
‘Uh’ but on and off ‘eh’ because I’ve been inside prison. Since I was 17 years old.
OK. Can you describe to me what is your alcohol tolerance?
It depends whether you drink beer or or drink liquor.
So in this case ‘uh’ how about beer.
Beer:
‘Mm’
‘Ah’
So up to 10 cans of beer you can drink, ‘la’, before you finally get very drunk?
Yes
OK. Thus the other question I have was: so on this day ‘uh’ 7th of April, yesterday, ‘la’, how, in total how many cans have you drank for this for this incidence.  Before you all go to the room?
About 6 to 8
You drink 6?
Yes
So it’s within your alcohol tolerance, ‘ah’? Any where … so that day, 6 cans. Anything else that you drink? Alcohol?
‘Uh’
Did you mix?
I mix with, with ‘uh’ ‘uh’ some ‘uh’ with my friend, one.
No, did you mix, mix with other alcohol drink?
No, no, no.
Or just the 6 cans of beer, ‘la’?
‘Ah’
OK.
Now. All right. ‘Mm’
And you’re not sure how much she drank? The red-shirt girl Mindy. Mindy or Mandy?
Mandy
Mandy
Mandy? OK.
He said
He said the word ‘Mandy’.
OK, so ‘uh’ … Then, listen to my question. Carefully. ‘Uh’ Anuar, you don’t understand, ask me, OK? So my question to you now is: based on what you say, ‘ah’, OK? Why would you allow sex with her, Mandy, knowing that she’s below 17, …
She’s drunk. And she consumed Pink. Why would you allowed  have sex with her, knowing about these 3 things?
Can you help me?
Firstly, because …
Because I was being ‘uh’ persuaded, pulled by her, and persuaded by her. That’s firstly.
OK, so second thing because I’ve not been doing this for a very long time.
Meaning?
OK. Having sex. OK.
How long?
Quite long, ‘uh’. Since ‘uh’ since ‘uh’ 36 month, ‘ah’.
Since when you 36 months inside?
Yes
You’ve not been having sex and all that? OK.
Until now.
And because she drink pink …
… and so it make you to become horny ‘la’? ‘Ah’ Your man
Desire
… desire, ‘la’. ... Got ‘uh’ rise, ‘la’.
Because temptation right in front of your eyes.
And was persuade like that.
So you felt …
Even though you feel scared, you feel you ‘uh’ want to succumb to your desire. ‘Ya’ ‘la’. You want to follow your desire, ‘la’.
You are scared of because …?
The place was … open place.
‘Ah’
Public place, ‘la’, you mean?
And like I felt like she might be very young.
I was scared because she was, she looks very, she was young, very young. But then but because I drank and then I got persuaded. I was being tempted by her, so …
I do that thing.
Understand.
Have sex with her, ‘uh’.
OK, OK. That what’s wrong with having sex with another person? I just want to find out.
It’s not wrong when … it’s, it’s, it’s not wrong when ‘uh’ it’s ‘uh’ willingly but, by law …
So what’s the definition of young?
Underaged
What’s the definition of …
He thinks she might be underaged
Maybe twen-, below 21 or 19, ‘eh’?
I think so
So you think is below 21 or below 19?
So you’re saying that as … in your opinion, any sex below with a person below 21 or 19 is against the law, is it?
So these are rumours that you hear about the law that it is wrong to have sex below 21 or 19.
But legally
What I know, ‘la’.
What you know is if you’re not mistaken is, is below 17.
Yes.
It is wrong, by law.
Yes
You’re that one you’re sure, ‘ah’?
You, you, you, you roughly …
Yes
… ‘uh’ think it is wrong, ‘la’.
Yes, yes.
You still … but you are not sure, ‘la’? For sure, you don’t know ‘la’.
You get all these references from …?
From friends inside the prison
Known through friends’ experience, ‘la’, ‘ah’?
Yes
OK. Correct me, if I understand correctly, ‘ah’? So just now earlier we got a question why would you allow sex with her when she was 17 years old? ‘Ah’, sorry, below 17 years old, drunk and consumed Pink Lady, OK? You said, first, firstly, you’re persuaded by her.
‘Mm’
Second, you’ve not been doing sex for a long time. And it should be about 36 months.
‘Mm’
Lastly, it was because both of you were drinking, and your man desire and temptation overtake you.
‘Mm’
And even when you’re scared, you still want to follow your desire.
‘Mm’ that’s correct.
You’re still scared but because it was a open space and she’s very young. So when my colleague asked you why is it wrong to have sex with someone young. You said it’s wrong because having sex with someone young ‘uh’ whereby they’re below 21 or 19 years old. This was what you heard. You think by law you cannot have sex with someone below 17.
Yes
Correct? OK.
‘Uh’ OK. OK, ‘uh’, can. OK, now what did police, what, what allegation against you ‘uh’ is slightly different from what you’re saying?
So ‘uh’ … how do I say … after hearing what you say, ‘uh’, I just want to let you know that there’s other allegation of sex happening between you and her, referring to her sucking your penis. So what do you have to say?
So sucking of my penis did not happen.
So the question you understand, ‘ah’? Mandy now alleged that you have asked her to suck your penis. You say never happened?
Never happened.
So, OK. So is there any other form of sex that happened? Bearing in mind, to us, to the law, the sex can be fingering. Can be like what you had mentioned licking her vagina also can. ‘Uh’ penile-vagina – penis go vagina. Penile-anal. ‘Uh’ …
… the finger-anal. ‘Uh’
‘Uh’ so apart from what you have mentioned, I’m asking you, is there any other sex that happened in the toilet?
No
Kissing
Sucked her breasts
Licking, ‘la’.
Licking her nipples, you mean? OK.
Licking her pussy
Licking her pussy
And then put a finger ‘uh’ inside his vagina.
Pussy also ‘la’?
Yes
Inside.
Anal, ‘uh’ oral sex to the mouth with penis, no.
Don’t have other things.
So, you only say 4 things? Kissing, licking nipples, …
Yes
… licking her pussy, …
‘Ya’
… putting your finger into her vagina.
Yes, correct.
Then, how long did you spend in the toilet with her?
Less than 10 minutes.
So can I ask you 1 more question?
OK
So at the time when you left the bench with Mandy, …
‘Mm’
… going to the toilet, …
‘Mm’
… at that time, did you know, sex is likely to happen?
That part of time …
No
No
Because ‘uh’ she says she wants me to follow her to the toilet. Because ‘uh’ …
No
Then why you think, what else, what other thing is likely to happen?
I thought I was just going to accompany her to the toilet.
Yes, yes, yes. And when she pulled me inside, then suddenly I realised something.
OK, with all due respect Mr Anuar, …
Yes
I know you’re 58 years old and know the girl is below 17, ‘uh’ so you’re telling me that, that by following a girl who’s below 17 to a toilet together ‘ah’ you don’t know what’s going to happen? You, being you as a 58 …
Yes
Yes, at, at the point when we were going, on the way to the toilet, I didn’t think …
You didn’t think about having sex.
Only when you were …
Pulling inside, then I, I
… when she pulled you inside …
I realised ‘uh’ something will happen.
So, so … only, only when reaching the toilet?
Yes
No, no, no. Not reach toilet. Other than. It was her, it was her who pulled you into the toilet. That is when you realised sex will happen.
‘Ah’ yes, yes.
He was pulled. He say one.
I was pulled.
So you said you’re pulled into the toilet, ‘la’?
Then he realised that sex will happen.
Yes.
Since you know that ‘uh’ having sex with a girl below 17 is an offense, why would you still want to have sex with her?
I already told you all in the …
‘Ya’, ‘ya’ ‘ya’. I know your temptation and all that.
‘Ya’
So did, did this thing cross your mind that you know that …
At that time, that moment, no.
So at that point of time, never think of that?
The commercial was there, right? So the temptation to have sex is there. So thinking about ‘uh’, about ‘uh’ is wrong, is not there anymore, OK? ‘Uh’ then suddenly when the, the door was knocked, right, I was realised I was doing something stupid.
So correct me. If I understand correctly, right, so you did not think about the offense part, and what you did was wrong. You just follow your desire.
Yes
Am I correct?
OK. ‘uh’ sorry, 1 more from me, ‘ah’? Now, ‘ah’, listen carefully. If you don’t understand, let me know, then will rephrase the question. So at any point in time, on also this incident, any point in time before you all reaches the toilet, ‘ah’? Did Mandy or anyone else told you about her age? Mandy’s age?
No
So nobody …
Nobody
… including Mandy mentioned about her actual age to you? ‘Ah’?
And 1 more. ‘Uh’ there’s another allegation against you ‘uh’ saying that ‘uh’ instead of what you … OK, so you told the police that she show you the Pink Lady, right?
‘Yeah’
So for us there’s this allegation against you, saying that you are the one to have given her the Pink Lady. It was you. What do you want to say about this?
OK, this allegation is …
Is not true.
Is not true.
…
Because ‘uh’ ‘uh’ before that, I didn’t even know what is ‘uh’ Pink Lady.
Yes
OK.
…
‘Ah’
OK
So you didn’t know about Pink. You know about Pink Lady but you forgot about it.
Yes
So when she mentioned it to you, only then you remember ‘uh’ that there’s this pill called Pink Lady
Yes, yes, yes.
So, anyway to the question that I asked you, saying that …
‘Ya’
… alleged to have given her the Pink Lady instead?
No
What you say this is not true, ‘la’?
This is not true. OK, because …
Because if I were to offer her the Pink Lady, ‘uh’ she can, Police can test her?
And me
Yours and hers ‘uh’ urine. Whether have the pill?
You mean to say if you, if …
If you offer and she doesn’t want …
‘ah’
… the pills. ‘Uh huh’.
… why did she object when she reject it ?
Why don’t she reject it? OK.
Sorry, sorry. Again? If you … what’s your last sentence?
If she didn’t want to take the Pink Lady, why did she not reject …
‘Ah’
… it from you?
Maybe just put it this way, ‘ah’? You …
He’s saying this, this, the allegation is mocking you ‘la’.
Is making you a mockery.
Accusing me to ‘uh’ sell this to her
Or ask her to consume it, ‘ah’.
When she was the one who took it out from her pocket.
So this allegation is totally baseless ‘la’.
And the allegation saying that I had assaulted her to have sex
Next time I’ll come to that
OK.
That’s the following question.
OK. OK. The question is that about the pill Pink Lady.
Yes
I, I don’t take, accept this allegation as saying selling the drug to her
Not asking selling. We’re asking whether you have give the lady the …
No
I’ll repeat the question, ‘ah’, and your answer again, ‘ah’? See whether it’s correct, ‘ah’? Question is: there is an allegation. Meaning that while inside the toilet, you have given …
Inside the toilet? No.
‘Ah’, you have given Mandy a pearl to consume. What can you tell me about it?
This allegation is not true.
‘Ah’, ‘ah’ so you told us that this allegation – it is untrue. It’s because you only remember about the Pink Lady when she told you about it.
‘Mm’ ‘mm’
You heard about the Pink Lady from last time.
Yes
If you’re the one who give her, the Police can conduct tests on you and her to confirm that you – if I am the one who offered the Pink Lady to her.
Yes
Her allegation is baseless. Correct?
She’s the … Correct. Correct. OK, she’s the one who offer me
This is what you say already.
‘Ya’ this is what you said. We’re asking you know. ‘Ah’
… to tell you now that every allegation is not true at the toilet. But it’s true when she was sitting with me and when she was offering me.
Now my, now my allegation to her back. She’s the one who offer me.
‘Ya’, ‘ya’. That’s what we captured ‘la’. OK?
OK. Can.
OK, so ‘uh’ my last few question. Now after hearing from what you say, ‘ah’, right, going on your account, why would this Mandy who’s below 17 ‘uh’ make up this allegation? That you sexually assaulted her and drugged her? Why would she want to say such thing against you?
OK, maybe ‘uh’ when you all, when she make a report, you all saw her very thick she or what. And ‘uh’ I don’t know why she made this allegation that ‘uh’ ‘uh’ I’m, I’m the one who’s selling the, the pills.
And …
OK, you only answered 1 part only, ‘ah’? Because we asked you why would a below 17 years old girl alleged you for sexually assault her, and drug her? You only answered the part that you do not know why she claimed that you’re the one who sponsor the pill to her, right? The sexual assault part?
Do you want me to repeat the question? Our question was, why would a below 17 years old girl …?
… alleged you have sexually assault …
… and drug
You have reply that you do not know why she claimed that I was the one who sponsor her the pills.
‘Ah’
But you have not replied the part on the sexual assault part.
Maybe because I did not perform the sex that she wanted.
So that’s why she lodged report against you? Because she never get what  ?
Or maybe means that she try to, to ask me to consume but I don’t want.
Maybe I left them …
OK, so maybe she was upset that I left the scene during the commotion without telling her anything, without, without saying anything ‘ah’. Just left like that.
Spoken in Malay)
I don’t know why she would make this kind of allegation.
OK, I’m coming to the end. Almost to the end of the interview.
Can we ask 1 question?
‘Uh’
OK. Only here we ask.
Maybe the last one. Last part. Last part we’ll let you …
Last part we’ll let you, ‘ah’. Because there’ll, there’ll be a part for you to explain yourself. If you have anything else to say. OK? But before that, let us finish first.
OK. OK.
OK, my question is, do you think it is not …
… normal for a girl,  Who is below 17 years old? Ask, ‘eh’ to ask for sex from someone who is so much older than her?
Normal
So maybe let me rephrase what my colleague asked. So I think he’s trying to ask you. You’re saying she’s below 17 and you’re 58, OK? So there’s a difference of 40 years of age. So given this gap: you’re 58, she’s below 17, ‘uh’ how … based on your account, how … how much likely it is for a 17 year old girl would ask for sex from a 58 year old man? How likely is it? Essentially this is what we are asking.
OK, to my point of view, ‘ah’, …
‘Ah’
… at least some of here … at this time of ‘uh’ year ‘ah’, with a new technology, with school opening up about sex everything, it’s normal. It’s normal. Frankly speaking, it’s normal, ‘ah’.
So you said it’s normal due to the recent technology
‘Ah’ Everything ‘la’. Because now it’s very open. ‘Uh’, ‘uh’ especially this Caucasian girl. They are, they are, they are, what you call that, ‘uh’
Open minded, are you saying that?
Open-minded, want to …
So you say ‘uh’ they are not virgin. They are no more virgin when ‘uh’ since young.
They are open-minded.
Let me summarise your, your answer, ‘la’. So you’re saying that you’re not surprised …
OK
… because girls ‘uh’ nowadays are more liberal.
Yes
Even in this current time or age, ‘ah’?
Sex education, and everything.
OK, so can I slot in a quick question? Did she tell you which country she’s from?
No
What do you think? Which country is she from?
I can’t imagine because she also use some slang, Singlish ‘la’.
OK. So do not know, ‘la’?
‘Ah’
OK. Can. My last question. Now ‘uh’ to be fair to you, I need to make known ‘uh’ that ‘uh’ this girl Mandy, red colour shirt, her age is 15. 1-5. OK? So, so now that we are at the end of this recording, is there anything you want to add before I conclude your statement?
‘Uh’ ‘uh’ 1 thing is that, if …
If I had assaulted her, …
… why didn’t she scream?
Or why weren’t, were there not bruises on her face?
Yes, yes.
Because to me, this allegation is ‘uh’ very heavy.
So this sex was actually ‘uh’ …
It’s like a … between a boyfriend and a girlfriend.
Let me clarify such … sexual assault is a term that we use to label sexual offences, including molestation and rape. Or sexual assault by penetration. So it doesn’t necessary involve ‘uh’ physical force. It’s a … all these essentially, if you touch a person, if you, if you ‘uh’ have sex with a person without consent, you will tantamount to the police as sexual assault. But I hope I make it clear to you in this recording what do we mean when we may use the term sexual assault. I hope you understand what we mean.
Correct.
It’s not what you have mis- misinterpreted as you must use force, to have injury, and then leaving to sex, then we call sexual assault. No, ‘ah’. Are you clear on that?
Yes
So long you touch me without permission. So long you penetrate me without permission ‘uh’ or consent, it may tantamount to …
Yes.
This is what the law states also.
OK.
All right. So I’m clear, ‘ah’?
OK
So that means what when my colleague asked the last question, is there anything else you want to say. When we tell you that she’s 15 years old. So you said that if you assaulted her she has no injuries on her, and why she didn’t shout at that time, sex at that time was consented, correct?
OK. So this is what you have said, correct?
‘Ah’
Anything else that you want to say before we conclude this statement? Other than what I have said, based on what you’ve told us?
And you know that she’s 15 now?
Anything else you want to say? Before finish this whole interview.
He’s asking is, is she the one who made the report?
There’s there’s not ‘uh’ …
We won’t be able to tell. ‘Uh’ we have no obligation to let you know who made the police report.
Yes
But what you know is there’s a police offence now that you have been …
… having sex with underage.
OK. OK.
Or I would say having sex with a minor.
OK
You know what is minor?
Yes, he’s not sure.
No, ‘ah’?
So the legal age is 16. So if anyone have any sexual intercourse with a person below 16, even though it’s consensual, it is an offence in Singapore.
Consent or no consent, below 16, it’s still an offence.
Yes, there would be sexual penetration of minor. Do you understand, Mr Anuar?
Mr Anuar?
OK, at least we are cleared, OK? So if you have nothing else to say, may I end the recording now?
‘Uh’ wait. Regarding the … Just want to ask about the sentencing.
OK. OK.
We will advise to you after we’ve made a decision. Now we are still not decided what to do yet. We will let you know.
But the most important thing: anything else you want to say? For this interview? Not anything about the sentencing? This one we can take it after this video recording.
No. At this moment, can’t think anything.
No, ‘ah’? OK. Can.
Sorry ‘ah’ I can’t think of anything to add.
OK. Can.
Now time is 3.55. I will end this recording.
38… OK Mister Chua, I am DSP Liao, this my colleague ASP Andy. So, previously we have already interview you on the 24 May 2021 ‘uh’ for the first video recorded interview ‘la’.

I’m OK, I’m OK.
So you can continue with the interview ‘ah’.
‘Ya’.
So for the purpose of this interview, it’ll be in English. OK, just want to confirm your… previous particulars whether is it still the same. Are you still an Operations Executive with Kon Meng San Monastery?

Your unit number?

‘Oh’ 0216 ‘ah’.
‘Ah’.
OK. So your… mobile number is 98280035.
‘Mm’.
Correct? Highest education is MBA. So purpose of this interview is ‘uh’, this the language for this interview will be in English. OK, so previously we have informed you that we are investigating into an allegation of sexual assault by penetration in for and outrage of modesty. ‘Uh’… inform by one Saresh OK.
So in your first interview, you have let us know that Saresh was your niece and her mother Seetoh Chee Leng was your ex-wife. OK, so Saresh was not your biological daughter ‘la’. OK. So, you also confronted on the allegations that Saresh made against you and you inform Police that you don’t remember the incidents and they are not true. Is that correct? ‘Uh’ you must say ‘la’.
‘Ya’, not true, not true.
‘Hor’. So, do you have anything to add with regards to the previous allegations that was said against…
No.
…you. Nothing to add ‘ah’. OK, so on 16 December 2021, last year OK, is a Thursday. You was ‘uh’, you were arranged to undertake a polygraph examination at Police Cantonment Complex Specialise Interview Branch. Can you confirm you have attended this interview?
Yes.
Do you remember who was… the interviewer? Was it a man or a woman?
Man.
Is a man, OK. So, you remember how long was the interview?
‘Uh’ quite long.
Quite long ‘ah’.
‘Ya’.
So, on that day do you, were you presented with any issues like, were you actually   or anything?
No.
No ‘uh’. So you’re OK ‘ah’ that day.
‘Ya’.
OK, so at this juncture, we have received the report for the polygraph examination. So I’m ‘uh’, I need to inform you that you are assessed to be probably not truthful. What do you have to say about this matter for the assessment?
I’m speaking the truth.
So I’m hearing was that even though you undertake the examination, you are very sure that what you said to the examiner was the truth.
Then what could be the reasons that you might fail the polygraph examination?
I don’t know. It is not the truth, I will not go for the… examination.
At that point of time, were you feeling anxious or nervous or anything?
Definitely because is the first time. I never do this kind of thing before.
So if you say that you were anxious or nervous, so if the allegations were not true why, why would you be anxious or nervous?
‘Orh’… I think is very normal that human nature you go through something that’s new to you.
‘Mm’.
Definitely you are anxious about it.
OK. So to add on to the first interview that we have with you, so we have interviewed a lot of parties after interviewing with you. So we have this one witness, I cannot reveal who, that reveal to us that, they have ‘uh’… the person have witness you touching Saresh before. What do you have to say about this?
Not true.
Is there anyone within your family…
…that is ‘uh’ total ‘uh’ how to say, got anything against you?
No.
So why would any of your family members make such an allegation towards you?
I don’t know.
OK. So do you agree that there is no reason for Saresh to come up with such a serious allegation against you after all this time you never see her?
I believe so.
So why do you think that she will make such an allegation?
I think maybe is the divorce. Me and my ex-wife.
How does this affects Saresh?
In the first place I think she felt that ‘uh’…her… biological mother…
‘Mm’.
…married me, she feel a lost. That’s about maybe like…
‘Mm’.
…19 years ago.
OK.
So recently we divorce.
‘Mm’.
So… she felt that I hurt the mother. ‘Ya’, that’s all I am presume ‘la’.
OK. So you’re…
…so you’re saying that you believe that your divorce between Madam Seetoh had affected Saresh.
I think so.
So… you s… you’re, what you believe was that ‘uh’ Saresh had made such an allegation because you have hurt the mother.
I think so.
Are they trying to get in touch with you for anything?
No, we… ‘uh’ not in touch.
So you’re not in touch with Madam Seetoh and…
Madam Seetoh obviously we are in touch ‘la’ because of the children. ‘Ya’, the children are 6 still very young. ‘Ya’, only the 3 that’s 18 ‘ya’.
Then with regards to Saresh and the siblings…
No, no, no contact.
Not in touch ‘ah’. So, when you are in contact with Madam Seetoh, did you all discuss on anything?
No. We only talk about the children.
OK, so I repeat. So since the first interview last May and today after the polygraph examination, ‘uh’… whatever allegation that I inform you, ‘uh’ that was being said by Saresh, you have inform the Police that ‘uh’ it did not happen. And you have believe that ‘uh’ why Saresh is making such an allegation towards you was because… ‘uh’ because of the divorce between you and Madam Seetoh in ‘uh’ you believe that ‘uh’ she reported you because you have hurt the mother.
I think so.
OK. That’s, that’s what you believe ‘la’. So, in that, with regards to… your other children, any issues you have with them?
No.
Because what I know about Saresh ‘uh’…
‘Mm’.
…from the mother ‘ah’.
‘Ah’.
‘Uh’… she… work in a ‘uh’… night club or something.
OK.
‘Ya’, that’s not what I ask. That’s what she tell me.
OK.
So and also she ‘uh’… didn’t pass her ITE.
OK.
So… I don’t know what kind of problem she, she went into ‘la’.
OK.
Because all the while ‘uh’… the… she and her 2 sibling are… ‘uh’ take care by our ma, the mother.
OK.
So until ‘uh’… we… are together…
‘Mm’.
Then… the father take over.
‘Mm’.
So I believe the father ‘uh’… can’t control her ‘la’. That’s why she, she go through that path down the road in her… future ‘la’. So I, I don’t know this…
‘Mm’.
…‘uh’… implicate anything that happen now or not.
OK. So what you just told me was that ‘uh’ Saresh was, is working in a night club and never pass her ITE. So, her siblings and her was, was use to be cared for by the mother until you got together with the mother then the father took over.
‘Mm’.
So you said that the father also cannot control her.
Or I believe so. Because all the while the… ‘uh’… care and control is the mother. ‘Ya’.
OK, can we noted this part. OK.
This is not what I find out ‘la’.
‘Ah’.
The… the mother…
What is said.
…tell me. ‘Ya’, the mother tell me.
But you never   ‘la’.
I didn’t go and find out anything about her ‘ya’.
So that’s what Madam Seetoh told you.
‘Ya’.
OK. So, before I conclude this interview, you got anything else you want to add?
No.
OK. So, these are the questions that I want to clarify with you before we can move forward with the case ‘la’. Similar as before, ‘uh’ this case in not concluded yet, so is still ‘uh’… still not suppose to contact with Saresh.
‘Ya’. No worry ‘la’, I… I… ‘uh’ participate in your investigation.
‘Ya’. So ‘ya’, this is just a reminder.
‘Mm’.
‘Hor’. So until we have an outcome, then I’ll inform you.
‘Ya’.
OK, so if there’s nothing else, we shall conclude this further interview.
OK. Then another… ‘uh’ question ‘ah’. ‘Uh’ regarding my hand, handphone ‘ah’…

…to Jia Wen?
‘Hm’?
‘Ah’.
She’s my child.
‘Mm’.
I see her like this outside…
""...
…I feel very painful also.
She will come back and tell me with…
So…
…this person, with that person.
‘Mm’. So I w…no, I want to understand… ‘tsk’ why would you put your fingers into her vagina? Why would you go and licked her vagina?
…
…
…
… …
‘Ah’.
…
""...
…
‘Mm’.
… …
Usually she will…
…
…always come and ask, she will come and ask and say like can satisfy her or not?
‘Mm’.
Then I couldn’t hold my ground. And then that is my fault.
‘Mm’.
If not ‘uh’ I see that she’s always outside trying to satisfy herself.
‘Ah’. …
‘Mm’. So, so what did she come and ask you initially?
?
Asked about all these sex things.
Did she ask you to do it on her?
Initially yes.
Then…
So what…what’s your response to her?
‘Aiya’…
‘Ah’.
But it’s all the father’s fault. I cannot hold my ground.
I don’t want to explain anymore.
. ‘Mm’.
It’s all the father’s fault.
The child is not at fault.
‘Mm’.
Because she is young.
She is naïve. Don’t know how to think.
But me as the father I also never use my brain.
I regret a lot.
…
OK.
… …
‘Mm’.
…
So by coming here today I hope that my conscience would be easier on me.
OK. So one thing to clarify is the number that happened.
OK. So Jia Wen was saying that it happened a lot of times. Definitely more than 7 or 8 times.
…Jia Wen…
‘Ah’.
So are you very sure that it only happened 7 to 8 times?
…argue ‘la’.
OK. If she say like that then I don’t want to…
…argue.  ‘la’.
…argue also. Because I also cannot remember.
…argue…  ‘la’.
I’ll just…
I will just let her be.
‘Ah’.
I don’t want to argue. If not later need to confront one another. More headache for me.
Because it’s very difficult for her now also.
‘Uh’ OK. ‘Uh’ I want to know from your point of view…from what you remember. OK. Does it happen every month?
OK.
‘Mm’.
?
No, but initially. Because it happened for 2, 2 years plus. Initially does it happen for every month?
I really cannot remember
And sometimes a lot of thing I cannot remember.
OK.
I really is…
So 1…just one more incident to clarify on ‘uh’ the sexual acts.
OK.
OK. So…there was…once in ‘uh’ when Jia Wen was Sec 2. ‘Uh’…she mentioned about you having a quarrel with your wife and subsequently you went to her room to sleep with her. Is there such a hap…such a thing?

Then she quarrelled with the younger sister. Then I have no choice then go over and sleep there.
So, you…there was once that you have slept with Jia Wen ‘la’, in the same room?
Yes, 1 time.
‘Ah’. Then… ‘uh’…
‘Ah’. Anything happened during that night?
?
OK.
I think so. She came on….herself.
So what happened that night?
?
I cannot remember already. It’s of the same kind of things.
But can you gen…generally tell me anything sexual happened that night?
OK. ?

Cannot.
… …
‘Ah’.
How to put?
OK.
‘Ya’.
…
‘Mm’.

OK. So ‘uh’ I myself can…is not capable in that area already. So even my wife asked me to ownself masturbate, I also tell her
how do I do that? I cannot stand.
OK. So…can you share a bit more why did you move out of the house?
My wife ‘lor’.
OK…
She say that the children don’t like me. So tell me try my best not to go back home.
Did she say why the children don’t like you?
?
She say that they’re very unhappy with what I did.
Does…OK, what…did she say what did you do?
OK. She say like ‘uh’ you’re such a brainless father, a beast father, who will accept you.
‘Ya’. OK. So when she said those things, what do you inter…interpret?
…
‘Mm’.
…
OK.
OK. Since my wife say like that then I don’t want my children to…I don’t want things…
…to be difficult for my children…
OK.
….so I went to the seaside to sleep.
So did you leave the house because you know that you have done sexual things to Jia Wen?
OK.
…
‘Mm’.
…
I feel very ashamed and guilty…
…
…about all these as a father.
‘Mm’.
…
‘Mm’.
…
‘Mm’.
So in order to make things not so difficult for them, I myself go outside and stay. But I still go and work and earn money and give them the money.
OK. So…for the acts that you have done, you mentioned inserting the fingers into her vagina, licking her vagina, putting sex toy into her, all these are against the law. Are you aware of it?
OK.
OK. Initially I didn’t think so much but after that I will think that I really did something wrong as a father.
‘Ya’, OK. We, we definitely know that it’s morally wrong. But do you know that it’s wrong against the law?
I have no choice as a father.
‘Mm’.
I know the law yet I break the law.
So I admit ‘la’. I’m in the wrong.
I admit I’m in the wrong.
I hope the days will be easier in future also.
OK.

OK in your first VRI ‘ah’, you mentioned that you are…In …
…your first interview, sorry. You mentioned that you, you knew about ‘uh’ your second brother Luqman ‘ah’?
‘Ya’.
Going into Jannah’s room.
‘Mm’.
OK ‘uh’ which year was this?
I can’t remember because…
Is it before you started or after you started?
That one also can’t remember.
You can’t remember.
‘Ya’. But I know its night time ‘la’.  .
Night time?
Night time, ‘ya’ when I was about to go to the toilet. ‘Uh’ I was, I was having ‘uh’ having stomach pain.
‘Mm hm’.
‘Ya’. Because I, I saw him ‘uh’ my second brother…
‘Mm hm’.
…he went through inside ‘uh’ …
…
…my sister ‘uh’ sister room ‘ah’.
‘Mm hm’.
So I was told ‘la’ what happen.
OK.
And I just let it be ‘la’. I know it’s a wrong thing to do because I, I know it must be something happen between my sister…my sister and my second brother. So ‘ya’, but I’m the one who decided not to open up myself to  . Saying that it’s wrong.
Do you recall how frequent you saw this?
I’m not sure.
More than one time? Or only one time?
I think more than one time ‘ah’.
More than one time.
Most of the time I keep quite ‘ah’. Because we seldom talking to each other.  …
Just now you mentioned that you know that it’s wrong to go inside Jannah’s room ‘uh’ can you explain why it is wrong to go into Jannah room?
‘Uh’ because my mother always says …
‘Mm’.
…my mother …
OK.
Can I say…?
.
Sure, sure, sure go ahead.
Go ahead first, ‘ya’.
.
Her mother always says that everyone has their own places. Boy’s room, girl’s room.
‘Mm hm’
So I cannot go into the girl’s room.
OK.
.
‘Ah’ that’s it.
You cannot go into the girl’s room or the boy’s shouldn’t go into the girl’s room?
‘Uh’ the boy’s shouldn’t go into the room.
OK. Is this also the same for the girl’s? That they cannot go to the boy’s room?
Yes. Unless we ask both …
‘Uh huh’.
…both ‘uh’ both ‘uh’ side ask permission then whether can we go in or not then we go in.
OK.
OK so, ‘uh’ I’ll just recap. So you say that you remember seeing ‘uh’ Luqman going into ‘uh’ the girl’s room, Jannah’s room in…at night. So you remember the first is because you went to toilet because you have stomach ache and then you saw Jannah going ‘uh’ you saw Luqman going into the girl’s room.
You do know that ‘uh’ it is wrong to not…to for  …to go inside the room. And then ‘uh’ but you chose to keep quiet about it.  It happen more than one time. You saw him going to the room happen ‘uh’ more than one time.
‘Ya’.
OK. So I ask you to explain why you say it’s wrong to go into her room. So you say that your mom ‘uh’ taught all of you that everyone have a…has your own places. So the boy’s shouldn’t go into the girl’s room and the same goes to the girl’s, they shouldn’t go to the boy’s room. And if any of you want to go into the other’s room, you need to ask permission,
Yes.
OK.
OK, let’s go towards what you did ‘ah’. So other than the kitchen toilet, were there any sexual acts ‘uh’ between you and Jannah that happen at any other parts of the house?
It did happen …
‘Mm’.
…on inside the bed room ‘la’. But it’s only, it’s only about few times ‘la’.
Whose bed room.
‘Uh’ my sister room.
Your sister’s room. ‘Uh’ for this occasions would it be …
‘Uh’ this occasion when it started it’s already change into toilet. Kitchen toilet.
Meaning? It already change into …
‘Uh’
Meaning?
…rule ….
‘Mm’.
… .  ‘eh’ about rules and regulations  …
‘Mm’.
…  kitchen toilet.
So I, I did ‘uh’ before my mother make this rule about her ‘uh’ about the rules I did it inside his room. So after ‘uh’ this rules and regulations I switch it into the toilet.
OK.
So correctly done, I say correctly ‘ah’, so before your mother make the rules because you say that occasion happen in Jannah room not a lot, few times. So that few times, was happen in the room first no toilet?
OK  ‘Spoken in Malay’
‘Ah’  toilet.
Yes, before the toilet.
OK. So only after the rules then change to the toilet?
So after the rules then change to the toilet?
Yes.
Yes.
OK.
Also in your first interview, you mentioned that ‘uh’ you share one room with your brother’s, all your sister share one  room right?
Yes, Ma’am.
Then the other remaining room is your parent’s room. Has this always been the same sleeping arrangement?
‘Uh’…
…
‘Mm’.
… (Spoken in Malay?
‘Mm’.
yes, .
‘Oh’ since in the past it was like this.
Yes, in the past ‘ah’.  living room so…
… …‘ah’.
OK. So when we the boy’s grow big right, some of us wants to sleep inside the ‘uh’ in the living room. So we take turns to sleep in the living room.
.
As fast as we grow bigger, the boy’s room is smaller. ‘Uh’ I mean ‘uh’  …
Squeeze ‘ah’.
…squeeze.
‘Mm’.
Crowded.
‘Uh’ was…how…
How long have you been staying in this house?
?
.
If I am not mistaken 21 years ‘uh’ same as my age.
OK. So was there any point of time where the girl’s will sleep in their parents, in their room.
?
‘Uh’  ‘ah’  last. ‘Ah’.
Only the youngest.
Her, her name is Maisarah.
‘Mm hm’.
There’s only, only her ‘la’. ‘Ya’ that she will sleep…
Will sleep with your mother.
…only sleep with, with her parents ‘ah’. Sometimes with, with ‘uh’ with the boys also ‘la’.
OK. OK.
‘Uh’ was there any point of time where you all have a …has someone else staying in the house, and they were occupying the girl’s room? Before the girl’s change to the current room.
‘Uh’ last  ‘uh’ …
‘Mm’.
… . ‘Ah’.
When…in past when my grandmother was still around…
‘Mm’.
…that room was supposed to be my grandmother’s.
OK can.
‘Ya’.  side  girl’s room.
After my grandmother has moved out to follow my father side…
‘Mm hm’.
…‘uh’ that room ‘uh’ becomes the girl’s room.
Do you remember ‘uh’ when this is? That you grandmother
…moved out?
It was long before when I still young ‘ah’.
When you’re still young ‘ah’?
‘Ya’.
You still young then the girls haven’t born yet what. How young were you?
Not really sure ‘ah’.
You can’t remember?
Not say young ‘la’ but around maybe around primary what like that. If I’m not wrong. ‘Ya’.
You primary school the…
…
…Jannah would have already born already ‘meh’? Jannah and you were nine, eight years apart you know.
It was very complicated to tell ‘ah’ because that time we, we don’t know  …
So as far as you can remember, the girl’s had always have their room? Since they were young.
Yes.
OK.
So that means to your summary is when your grandmother moved away the room become the girl’s room?
Yes.
OK.
And then for the girl’s right, ‘uh’ are they allow to lock their door if they want?
‘Ya’.
Can, they can? So any …did, did your parents ever say that they shouldn’t lock the door?
Most ‘uh’ .
‘Uh’ my mother always say the girl’s room, the door must be close and lock.
Sometimes, ‘uh’  lock .
Sometimes my siblings forgot to lock the door.
The siblings he refer to the girl’s ‘la’?
Yes.
Have you ever told your sister’s not to lock their room door?
‘Uh’  rule ‘ah’.
After my mother make this rules, I have ever told my sister or sister’s …
‘Mm hm’.
…‘uh’ to close and lock the door.
OK but have you ever told them not to lock the door?
?
.
That one never.
So we were told that Jannah would be scolded if she lock the door. Is this true?
?
.
No.
Has it ever happen before that she lock her room and then something happen?
.
.
That one I don’t know.
OK. OK so, so the allegation ‘ah’ there’s one allegation that in 19…2019 in the middle of the night ‘ah’ you ask Jannah to come, come out….
…from your parents room and then you brought her to your room. In the boy’s room and then you remove her clothes, then touch her breast, you put your finger into her vagina. Did this thing happen before?
‘ah’.
‘Ah’, Ever once only
OK. Can you tell me about it?
.
I can’t really remember that much.
toilet  ‘uh’ .
Because whatever I did inside the room, I did the same thing at that time.
.
If  …I can, I can say …
‘Ah’.
‘Uh’ what was it, I couldn’t hear the last part?
‘Uh’ .
That’s all I can remember.
So what you can remember is that whatever you did to her is all awhile it’s been the same.
Yes.
It’s the same acts so but inside the room it did happen before? One time?
Only one time.
Only one time?
Yes.
Night time, day time? Do you remember?
I can’t remember.
You can’t remember. ‘Uh’ brother’s around?
No.
Not, your brother’s not around ‘ah’?
‘Ah’ not around.
OK.
…”
…Night.
Brother’s not around?
‘Uhm’?
…brother not around.
He cannot remember whether it’s day or night. You’re quite sure your brother is not around ‘ah’?
?
.
I not sure because I can’t really remember.
So what she claim middle of the night, you cannot remember whether what she say is correct, but you remember …you also cannot remember whether it’s in the day or night?
‘Ya’.
But you remember brother is not around ‘la’?
Not around or can’t be sure?
I can’t be sure also.
You can’t be sure.
‘Ah’.
OK but you do know that there’s  one time that it happen …
Yes.
…in your room.
‘Ah’.
OK. That’s fair enough. OK.
OK so I just want to confirm ‘ah’ when you say it ever once happen in the room ‘ah’, although I understand in your earliest interview with us right, you say that it happened in the toilet, all the things right? I just want to be very sure when you say did it in the room, what you did in the room? What kind of acts you did in the room?
The same process whatever I did, kissing, licking, touching her breast, put inside her vagina everything included.
OK so kissing? I, I need you to explain, Kissing and some more what?
‘Uh’ kissing…
‘Mm hm’.
…then I open clothes.
Open clothes. OK. Then some more?
And then touch her breast.
Touch her breast. OK Anymore?
Lick her vagina.
OK.
I tried to finger her around the vagina.
Try to finger?
Finger around the vagina.
OK.
And try to put inside her vagina but couldn’t also. Using my hand. Then ….
‘Ah’, but you tried to finger her but did it go in?
No.
You try to finger her but it didn’t go in ‘ah’?
‘Ya’.
And try to put the penis but didn’t go in also?
Yes, it’s correct.
Can, OK.
‘Uh’ when sexual acts took place in Jannah’s room, the girls room, are the rest of your sister’s around?
‘Ya’.
They are around?
Yes. They were sleeping.
They were sleeping. And this would happen during day time or night time?
Sometimes day time sometimes night time. That one …
They never wake up?
Sorry?
Never ever woken up before?
?
Sorry? No?
No, no, no.
No is it? OK. So your sisters will be around, they will be sleeping and then ‘uh’, ‘uh’ sometimes they …this happen sometimes in the day time or sometime in the night.
Yes.
They never wake up at all ‘la’? OK.
OK.
And then have any of the sexual acts happen in your parent’s room before?
Parents room no.
OK.
Never ‘ah’?
‘Ya’.
OK Saifuddin …
Yes.
…other than Jannah did you also sexually assault your second sister Junah?
No, only Jannah.
Only Jannah?
Yes, Ma’am.
Maisarah?
No, Ma’am.
Can you help us to understand why only Jannah?
Jannah, .
Why I chose Jannah I do not know, I’m not sure …
‘ah’.
... I didn’t even think that that is my sister.
.
I did it without thinking.
‘ah’, that’s all ‘ah’.
That’s all.
? OK.
So I just confirm what you say. You said that you do not know why.
‘Ah’.
You are not sure, you never think that she was your sister. You did it without thinking.
Yes, Sir.
OK.
OK. OK ‘ah’?
‘Mm’.
Are you aware if any of your brothers have also sexually assaulted Jannah?
.
Jannah?
‘Uh’  most, most of the time  Jannah ‘la’.
I only know my second brother but most of the time I didn’t know what did he did ‘uh’ with Jannah.
When you says second brother, can you tell us the name?
‘Uh’ Luqman.
OK when you say you know, is this because you saw it or he told you? Or you suspect he did? This are very different.
‘Uh’ I suspect he did.
You suspect he did?
‘Ah’.
OK.
The moment when he I think want to go inside the toilet...
‘Mm’.
…and then when I say I was having stomach pain.
‘Mm’.
Then when I go out the lock was, the door was lock at night.
Close.
Close.
Not close.
‘Ah’.
The door is close.
To the door, so I was like thinking is my brother, second brother inside or not.
OK.
So without saying anything I just keep quiet, I just go inside my own room and I saw my second brother not inside my, the boy’s room. So I suspected that he’s in my sis, ‘uh’ sister room.
OK so, you said that time when you say that you have your stomach ache, you came out from the toilet then the girls room was closed ‘uh’ you went back to your room, your brother ‘uh’
…Luqman is not inside the room. So you suspect he’s inside the girl’s room.
Yes.
OK.
But you just now you did mentioned that ‘uh’ the room was lock. How do you know that the room was lock?
Because I try to open but couldn’t.
OK. So when you try to open is only when you go back to the room and saw he’s not there, then you and try to open? Or you try to open first before you go back to the room and you saw he’s not there.
Before, before I go out into the room when I was having stomach ache…
‘Mm’.
I saw the lock ‘uh’ I saw the door was open.
‘Oh’ OK.
‘Ya’. So usually my sister’s will always forget they should lock the door. So I just roughly close ‘uh’ just ‘uh’ .
Shut the door ‘la’?
Close the door.
Shut OK shut OK the meaning of shut, completely close or just a bit?
‘Ah’, .
OK, slightly a jar.
OK.
Then after that ‘uh’ I went inside the toilet then I just do whatever shit I do.
‘Uh huh’.
Then after that when I go out the door was totally lock. And then …
Tot…OK lock means latching ‘eh’.
.
.
So …
Latching is locked.
So  after I go towards the door, then I was like thinking, I thought I was, I put the door roughly close.
‘Mm hm’.
Then when I try to mingle around the…
‘Mm hm’.
…mingle around the door knob…
Door knob. ‘Mm’.
It’s locked. So I suspected it was my second brother.
OK but at that time you don’t know that your second brother was inside ‘la’?
‘Ah’. At first I don’t know ‘la’.
Only until you go back to the room?
Yes.
You saw he’s not there?
Yes.
…
…suspect your brother is inside ‘la’?
‘Ya’.
OK.
‘Oh’ OK, Ok so you actually didn’t see your brother go inside your sister’s room?
‘Ya’, first I didn’t see.
‘Oh’.
‘Ya’. When I, after when I go out inside the toilet, after I go out the toilet…
‘Ah’, OK.
…then I check my room first.
‘Uh huh’.
Whether my four brother have or not.
‘Uh huh’.
Then I suspected my second brother don’t have.
‘Ah’.
So I go inside, not say go inside ‘ah’, I just go outside the door, my sister room and check whether the door lock or not. ‘Ya’. But then it’s already lock. So I suspected my second brother ‘la’ inside.
So that means after you see you brother is not inside you go out again and check the door.
‘Mm’.
OK. So listen to the sequence ‘ah’ whether is it correct ‘ah’. ‘Uh’ you have stomach ache first, you came out of the room, you saw your door ‘uh’ your sister room door is open, that they forget so slightly close, to almost close but not close.
‘Ya’.
Then you go toilet.
Yes.
You finish your business you come out you saw the door was closed.
Totally close. And locked.
Totally close then you thinking why totally close but you try and it was locked.
Yes.
Then you go back in the room you saw your ‘uh’ your
…brother Luqman is not there.
‘Ya’.
So you go out again and check the door, and it’s locked. So you suspect he’s inside?
Yes.
Then but you don’t want to think so much about it then you just go into the room.
‘Ya’, I go back to the room and just sleep.
OK. So that is the sequence?
Yes.
Is that Correct?
Yes.
‘Uh’ can ‘eh’? You want me to translate it?
.
OK.
You understand ‘ah’? OK. So that means you never see him going into the room?
‘Ya’.
You only know that he’s inside the room?
Yes.
Then corr ‘uh’ I just want to understand, because you told my colleague …
‘Mm’.
Fang Chee that  you only know that he did something to her. What do you mean by you know that he did something. What is the something that you think?
Like some…‘Uh’  ‘eh’  …
What I did …
…towards Jannah .
‘Mm hm’.
.
I could feel …what I did to Jannah I could feel that my younger sibling also did the ‘uh’ same.
When you said your brother, you’re referring to Luqman only?
Luqman.
Luqman only?
Yes.
OK.
Because all this while I only saw my second brother. My third brother and my fourth brother was nothing.
OK. So this particular sequence that you mentioned just now, was a one time? Before this you told me you saw him going to her room before a few times. Is that accurate or not?
That one…
OK I don’t want to guess.
‘Ah’.
I don’t want you to guess.
‘Ah’.
OK, I know you have a suspension, we will come to that later. I want to know whether you have seen with your own eyes before. What you have seen before.
I’ve seen most of the time the door close.
OK.
So I suspected my second brother inside. Most of the time…
‘Ya’, that’s all I can say.
Have you ever seen him go into your sister’s room?
No.
…at least once? Or once.
‘Ah’ no, not so far no.
So all the time is you think he’s inside.
‘Ya’. Because I know the moment when he, when the moment the door is locked in my sister room, and I check …usually I will check my brother’s room first.
OK.
To see all the four brother’s is inside or not.
OK.
So see ‘uh’ whether Luqman inside, Fikri inside…
‘Uh huh’.
Firdaus inside.
OK.
So if none of them inside, mean something wrong. So some, when, when I think about it, if one person missing means must
…be something going inside my sister’s room.
You are referring to them as missing, ‘uhm’ is it because before you saw them missing they were at home. Could it be that …
…at home.
…they are out of the house?
They…when they go out of the house they usually tell me ‘la’. ‘Ya’.
OK. OK.
Most of the time I sleep in the living room.
‘Ah’.
Now a days I sleep in the living room.
OK.
So I know my brother, where are they going. Because most of the time number…my third brother, Fikri…
‘Uh huh’.
He  …all this.
OK.
So I just sleep outside ‘la’. For the time being.
OK. OK so, let’s clarify this once and for all, once and for all ‘ah’. So you never really saw you brother entering your…the girl’s room, OK. What happen was that ‘uh’ you saw that your ‘uh’ the girl’s room were locked. You checked that your brother’s your brother’s are not around, If either of the brother’s not around and then you suspect that they are in the girl’s room.
Yes.
This only happen to Luqman ‘uh’ also happen to Fikri and….
Firdaus.
Fir…Firdaus.
Fikri, Firdaus I not really sure…
You are not really sure.
…because mostly I…I more close to my second brother than my third brother and my fourth brother.
OK. OK.
OK, but do you ever see Fikri or Firdaus missing like how Luqman was missing in the room?
I saw Fikri missing…
‘Mm hm’.
But he didn’t go inside Jannah room. ‘Ya’.
…
Most of the time Fikri…OK, most of the time Fikri and Firdaus…they only go home late because of their work…
OK.
…or they go out with friends also.
OK, OK.
‘Ya’. My mother always…how to say, nagging about them. ‘Ah’.
So when they are missing, they are not…you don’t suspect they are in the room ‘la’?
‘Hm’.
Only Luqman…when missing, you suspect he is in the room?
‘Ya’.
Only him? Am I correct?
Yes. I just don’t know why, because I got the feeling me and him like some…like some…some .
Sixth sense ‘la’.
‘Ya’.
Sixth sense is that…Luqman is also doing the same thing as what you did ‘la’?
Yes.
OK… Have you ever told anyone… ‘uh’ I mean…have you ever told your brothers about what you did to Jannah?
No.
Never.
No.
Have they ever told you what they did to Jannah?
No.
Or any of them did to Jannah? No.
‘Ya’.
So there were never any discussions.
There were no discussion, no…most of the time we…me and my brothers were arguing about something else…about other problems…
OK.
…about scolding, about…work…
OK.
…about everything.
OK.
‘Ya’.
OK.
So nothing to talk about…between you, and your brother about what you all going to do to Jannah?
No.
Never at all?
It’s like never, ever.
So if you suspect that Luqman is also doing the same thing, do you know which one of you started first?
We…I also don’t know.
You also don’t know?
‘Ya’.
‘Hm’. Have you ever told your brothers not to enter the girls’ room?
Yes.
Reason?
After my mother made this ‘uh’ rule then I told my 4 brothers ‘la’…
‘Mm hm’.
…including myself…
‘Mm hm’.
…not to go inside my sister room. ‘Ya’.
When you say your brothers right, do you mean…
All…
…all 3 of them?
…the 3 of them.
OK so Saifuddin, you have been here for how many days already? Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday…

So which year, this…
2019. That was the first.
Which is what you, mention yesterday already also right?
Yes.
So, I’m trying to sort out, this ‘uh’, the first 2 recording, what you said, I’m trying to put it in ‘uhm’, ‘uh’, chronological order. ‘Hor’. So that we can understand better.
Can.
So, 2019, ‘uh’, your room, and, you, what had happened? The in, in terms of the acts that have listed to you.
Meaning?
OK, what… So, ?
The first, the first order, I ‘uh’, I ask her, whether to have sex or not with her, and then ‘uh’, firstly, she say, nothing, because she no respond to me, so I was take it as a yes. After that, without hesitation, or without my own thinking also, I will just do it with her, inside my bedroom, I take out my shirt…
‘Uh’, so this is what you said also yesterday right?
So, can I just ‘uh’, the, summarize back to you what you told us yesterday, you just tell me whether is it accurate. So, yesterday you told us, ‘ya’, there’s ‘uh’, you try to put your finger in.
Yes.
But it didn’t went in.
No.
Right? And then, you also told us, you, ‘uh’, kiss, touch her breast, you lick her, vagina?
‘Ya’. I tried to.
OK. So what do you mean, you tried to?
I tried to kiss her.
‘Oh’…
‘Ya’.
‘Oh’… So, ‘uh’, touch breast and, ‘uh’, lick vagina ‘ah’.
Yes, Sir.
And then…
You also told us, this incident, as well that, you tried to put your penis in ‘ah’.
Yes, Sir.
So it’s a, attempted penile ‘uh’, vagina. OK. So, these are the things that happened, in that first incident.
Yes, Sir.
‘Ya’. And then ‘ya’, can we move on, ‘uh’, the last one in your me… in your memory, is when?
The last memory was in, back in the kitchen toilet.
So this is in the year?
2021.
OK.
That was the last one.
So that was the last one, is it?
Yes, Sir.
‘Uh’, not withstanding that, kitchen toilet happened a lot of time ‘ah’.
‘Ya’. Most of it is, happened in the kitchen toilet. ‘Ya’.
Alright, alright. So, and I suppose, correct me if I’m wrong, I suppose, ‘uh’, the, scene reconstruction that we did with you, the one that you, tell me the marking.
‘Ya’.
That ones is in the middle of the, the, the 15th ‘ah’. Am I right?
Yes, Sir.
OK. OK. So the last incident happened at the kitchen toilet. Do you know the month?
I can’t remember the month.
Your…birthday is May. After your birthday, before your birthday?
That one also I cannot remember.
OK. Can. So the last incident, are you able to tell us what acts you did with ‘uh’, Jannah?
The last, I did to her is the same thing, as the first scene.
OK.
‘Ah’, what  .
OK, ‘uh’, ‘uh’, how do I say. ‘Mm’… because we are not machine ‘ah’. So, so ‘uh’, you, ‘uh’, you need to elaborate, ‘uh’, not, not, not all incident would be the same one. I, I believe ‘la’. So, it will better for you to spell it out, ‘uh’, action that you remember. The, the, the, the, things that you remember, instead of, saying “The same one, the same one”. Because, ultimately, this is what you are telling us, so I, I think, it’s better for you to be detailed, ‘ya’, as it concerns you also.
Because, I ask, the same question.
Ask… what do you mean?
‘Uhm’… can I do sex with…
OK.
…Jannah or not.
‘Mm’.
And then, secondly, I tried to tease her.
And kiss her.
‘Mm’.
And then.
So did you kiss her?
I tried to kiss her, but she, most of the time, she rejected me.
OK.
So, I stop from the kissing that part.
‘Mm’.
After that, I moved on to, ask her the, again the same question, which is, can I have sex again or not. And then, without, answering with my own question, my mind was thinking, it could be a yes. So I just brought her into the, into the toilet, kitchen, and I ask her to open her shirt, open everything, and I also o…open myself. So we both nakedly. ‘Ah’. After that I, I try to kiss her back, but I didn’t manage to kiss her, because she still, ‘ah’, reject my kissing. After that I slowly touch her breast, then I put my finger, my left finger, middle finger in her vagina while standing position.
Did you, did your finger go in?
‘Ah’, didn’t. I tried to go inside, but I cannot go in.
Why?
Because her hole was so small. And I just felt my finger against her clit.
‘Uh’, OK. Then you go.
And then after that, I started to, after fingering her, around her clit, I started to…
OK. When you say, after fingering, so the finger didn’t went in.
‘Ya’.
So you just touch at the outside.
Yes.
OK.
After that, I, lick her breast, and then, as move down, slowly lick down to her vagina. But it didn’t happen, because…
What do you mean, lick vagina but it didn’t happen?
Because at, most of the, I was kneeling down and that point of time, most of my, my knee was injured at that time of point, so, I just, don’t… I don’t know what I was thinking in my mind, licking her vagina also.
So do you lick her vagina?
Yes, I admit there is.
OK. And then?
And then, I asked her to lie down.
‘Mm’.
Then, she lie down. Then I also lie down on the top.
So you are, on top of her ‘la’.
Yes, Sir. After that, I lick her, vagina again.
‘Mm’.
Just around her vagina. And I also did finger her.
Did you, did your finger went in?
It didn’t also.
OK.
No. After that I know that it didn’t go in, I still rub against her clit, and without hesitation, I was, without me thinking, I just ‘ah’, while saying anything to her, I just put my penis inside her vagina, but it didn’t go in. Then I rub against her clit.
Why it didn’t go in?
Because her hole was so small.
How you know it didn’t went in?
Because my, tip is ‘uh’, very big and I try to, not say force in ‘la’. I did try to manage to force, but I cannot. Because she, I know, if she say she don’t want, means she don’t want. So, but, I’m the one who forced it in. So I, cannot, cannot guarantee is, if went in or not. So I just rub against her clit.
Do you feel your penis going in her vagina?
No.
So you tried to ‘la’.
‘Ya’.
And this is when you are on top of her.
Yes, Sir.
And she’s lying down.
Yes, Sir. Correct.
OK. ‘Ya’ continue.
After that, ‘uhm’, after that I release my penetration.
Sorry?
My, my cum.
After you eja…
Ejaculate, my penis. My, my, ‘ah’, my semen. I, ejaculate at her stomach. After that I wash. I wash for myself ‘ah’. I wash for her, and I ask her to put back her clothes. Then, we get out from the toilet.
When you wash for her, what exactly you mean?
Mean, from the stomach, onwards ‘la’, only just from the stomach, because I know it wasn’t, it didn’t go in inside the, vagina.
Did… did you wash her vagina?
No.
OK. Your…
Your, when washing, your finger also never go in her vagina right?
Yes.
OK. Can. So this is the last incident.
Yes, Sir.
In 2021.
Yes, Sir.
OK. So in between the first and the last, are you able to, share with us, ‘uh’, in other, ‘uh’ incidences, and happening and where? So, you can, you… you choose how you want to ‘uh’, go on, either from 2019 after the first in your room, or you can go backtrack from the last one in 2021. So how, how would you prefer?
2019…
So tot…

OK
‘Uh’…
So you want to start from 2019 downwards ‘la’. OK, so after the first one that you already mentioned, there happen another 2 more time. Is that what you’re saying? OK. So… OK. At where? Is it… OK, we start with the second one ‘ah’, second 2019. At which part of, of?
At the, ‘uhm’… Nurul…
.
…the first… I can’t remember the sequence, but, whatever I did in the kitchen, is the same thing as the, whatever I ask her to do.
OK.
Yes.
To be fair to you, Saifuddin, ‘uh’… can you tell me the acts that you remember, for this particular incident? Because ultimately, ‘uhm’, how do I say, ‘uh’, try not to let us jump into conclusion ‘ah’, because you, it’s not good for you. ‘Hor’?
What I can remember is, I just put my penis inside her vagina, and I did penetrate.
It went in?
No, I didn’t.
So you try to put ‘la’.
I try to put, again I try to put…
OK.
…it didn’t go in. Then, I rub against her clit.
‘Uh huh’.
Then, when I ejaculate, on the stomach…
‘Uh huh’.
I use ‘ah’, tissue, normal tissue. ‘Ah’. Then I just wipe off, wipe, ‘ah’ around her stomach.
OK, so this is the second incident that you remember.
Yes, Sir.
So, the third one, in 2019, it happened at where?
I can’t remember.
OK. ‘Uh’… But, what, do you remember the action?
.
It’s the same thing. I… straight away, ask her to open her clothes… and then, I just, have sex with her. Meaning, I just put my penis inside her vagina.
Went in?
Which… didn’t also. Most of it, it didn’t went in ‘la’. Because I try to force in, but it cannot go in, because the hole is very small. Then, I just rub against her clit.

After, I ejaculate… same things happens, on the stomach.
Ejaculate ‘ah’.
‘Ya’.
OK.

So, OK, the kitchen, in 2019 OK. Kitchen toilet or kitchen?
Kitchen toilet.
‘Ah’… So, this is in 2019 also.
Yes, Sir.
What you remember?
The same question, I ask her. ‘Ya’. Can I do sex with her? Then I, go inside the toilet, I bring her inside, and straight away, before opening the shirt, I ask her to kneel down, and ask for the blowjob.
‘Mm’.
Then I give it to her.
Did, did, the, did the, your penis went into her mouth?
Yes, Sir.
Then?
And then…
And then ‘uh’, straight away, I… try to kiss her, afterward…
…after a few minutes, I try give her a blowjob, but it didn’t, went, in also.
Sorry, who try to who give who blowjob?
I try to give her.
So you lick her vagina ‘la’?
Yes.
Then, what do you mean by it didn’t went in? What didn’t went in?
My penis, inside her…
‘Oh’, so, you, you lick her vagina, and you try to again to put your…
Yes.
…put your penis into her vagina?
‘Ya’. And after that, I… I asked her to lie down, after everything ‘ah’, after everything, we open shirt, and I try to lick her, vagina, then I try to, put my penis inside the hole, which cannot. Then I rape… I, not say… I try to rub against her clit. Then… most of it, the incident happen, it manage to ejaculate around her stomach. ‘Ya’.

‘Uh’, if you…

…1 to 10, how many number, of this incidence?
Around, 7 to 8.
So, so kitchen toilet…

Not withstanding what you have just said, in total there’s around 7 to 8 incidences. Is that what you’re saying?

When was this? When did Saifuddin told you that?
A lot of time ‘ah’ but I don’t know when.
So he saw you go inside the room…
‘Mm’.
…many times before?

Why don’t go into the living room? The Wi-Fi should be at the living room. Why?

OK your mother or father ever saw you all go inside the room before or not?
‘Ya’.
Did they say anything?
They say don’t go inside. Inside the…
Did they come in and check?
Come in check… ‘uh’ no.
So, OK now what we have from Nurul was that when you touch her, your fingers will go into her vagina. OK? That’s what she told the Police. What do you have to say about this?
Mostly I never touch inside her ‘uh’. Put inside before.
Are you very sure about that?
Very sure.
So what…what I’m hearing from you, what you tell me…what you told me was, you touched her breasts, you touched her vagina a few times. But all never go in?
No, never.
So why did you only stop at the vagina? Why did you not go in? Since you…
Horny.
…horny.
Because I know it’s like the hole very small so  "" ... inside ‘uh’.
The what very small?
The vagina very small.
How you know the vagina very small?
Because I can feel what. Because she’s still at the age of like 12 years old so  "" ...
So you know that she’s 12, she’s very young. Then why go and touch her? I meant that’s a question for you to answer to us. So why you go and touch her?
Because I feel that I want to touch her ‘ah’. Like my anxiety.
Anxiety or urge? You know what’s urge or not?

‘Oh’ what I thought they do inside ‘uh’?
‘Ah’. So what, what, what, what do you think? I want to know.
I also don’t know.
Then why are you saying this out? In this interview. The question is asked to you that why you think your brothers are here. So when we asked you why…why, you saw your brothers here. I asked you why your brothers are here, you say they probably do, do something to Jannah. Then you tell me that you saw Luqman on 2 occasion bring Jannah to her room. So this investigation itself is a…is a sexual assault allegation. So my question to you now is why are you raising this when you don’t know anything? You…you saw him going in?
‘Ya’ I…I only saw. But I don’t know…
Yes.
…what happens.
‘Ya’ so at that time he…
So I thought that maybe he do something to her or…
…like what?
I don’t know like example, blowjob or something like that?
Why must it be sexual?
Because every time ‘uh’ what I go inside toilet, he like he ‘uh’ he very loud ‘uh’ inside the toilet.
OK.
Then I suspect that he have hand job, watch porn. And like OK ‘uh’, suspect that this confirm  "" ... to Jannah like that. Maybe she handjob to Luqman and maybe she blowjob, something like that to her.
So on these 2 occasion that you saw. How long he was in the room with Jannah? Was anyone else in the room?
Only both of them.
How sure are you? Since you are not inside the room.
Because I was outside.
OK.
Then my sister follow my, the fifth sister.
‘Uh’ any names, say the name all these.
‘Uh’ Jihan and Maisarah follow my mother to…to what, buy something.
And?
Then she… she come back around 15 minutes. So I guess it’s 15 minutes ‘uh’.
So he was in the room with Jannah for 15 minutes? Then how you know Jannah is at home?
Because Jannah never…never follow anyone.
Did you see Jannah that day before he went in?
‘Ya’, that’s why I was like going out to my room, go and sit down in the living room, play game. I saw Jannah was sleeping there ‘eh’ lying down in the bed and play game. Because she every time play phone.
Is it the same for these 2 occasion that you saw?
‘Ya’.
So ‘uhm’ OK so let me just recap for you. So you told me that the, you believe the 2 other brothers ‘uh’ namely this ‘uh’ Saifuddin and Luqman have also done ‘uh’ ss… ‘uh’ sexual, sexual stuff to Jannah and because you saw them going into Jannah’s room. Right? On a few occasion. So you zoom in to Luqman, you say in 2021, you saw him going into her room, twice, in the day. And when…when Jannah was, only Jannah was present in the room.
And on both occasion she was playing phone on the bed. And then you say at least 1 of the occasion, Luqman went in for at least 15 minutes. Is that right?
‘Ya’.
OK how about the second occasion? How long was he in?
Second actually like 5 minutes. Can say 5 minutes.
OK. So second occasion 5 minutes, OK. So you said, you suspect Luqman did something sexual because previously you noticed that he took long bath and then you suspect that he either watch porn or masturbate….
…and thereafter seeing, knowing him so and going into Jannah’s room for such a long time. That’s what…that’s what makes you say that he might have done something sexual to her. Is that ‘uh’? Can you confirm?
‘Ya’.
OK I need you to say.
Yes, yes.
Is there…so I backtrack to ‘uh’ OK ‘uh’ sorry, we go on to Saifuddin. What about?
Only I saw him once.
Which year? Which month? Which day? If you can’t remember, can you tell me how old were you then? Which year?
I was 17.
You’re now 19?

‘Uh’ then I saw him once ‘ah’ only like…like 5 minutes only.
So it happened day or night?
Still day.
OK. And who else is in her room?
Same person ‘uh’.
Got Maisarah or Jihan. Was she…was Jannah alone in the room?
Jannah was alone. I was outside with my sister and my ‘eh’ Nurul ‘eh’ who ‘uh’ Jihan and Maisarah was outside. And my mother go out alone with her friend. Then after that, I saw my brother go inside Nurul…
Saifuddin you mean?
Saifuddin go inside her room.
‘Uh’ what was ‘uh’ Jannah doing before he went in?
She play phone ‘uh’ she always play phone.
OK. So what makes you say that by him being a bro…elder brother to Jannah, going into her room and did something sexual to her? What makes you say that?
Because what I see for my second brother, Luqman. Can be happen also  "" ...
So are you saying that any male that goes inside Jannah’s room will definitely do sexual stuff to her? Are you saying that? If your father go inside the room, your father, you also will suspect your father do something sexual to her, is that what you are saying as well?
No.
‘Ya’ so with no, no for your father, why Saifuddin yes? I need to have a understand. Because I don’t live there, you live there. So why would you think by seeing Saifuddin go into her room?
Don’t know ‘uh’, I just feel it ‘uh’.
Feel it?
‘Ah’. That’s what I thought ‘la’, my thoughts ‘la’.
How long did Saifuddin went into her room that day?
5 minutes only.
So after he, after 5 minutes, what do you see?
Finish already ‘uh’. I just see he opened door then done. I keep on playing game only ‘ah’.

Because my TV very loud so I cannot hear.
OK. That’s all you say for Saifuddin?
‘Ya’, that’s all.
How about…
…Firdaus?
‘Oh’ Firdaus, I don’t know anything.
So you never see him go in?
I never see him.
OK. ‘Uh’ sorry, then I backtrack again to Luqman ‘uh’. So for Luqman, on the 2 occasion you saw the first time 15 minutes, second time 5 minutes. After he came out and Jannah, after…after their turn, do you see anything unusual about them? Their emotions, their reaction? Happy, sad, no reaction?
No Sir, I never see.
So ‘ya’ just let me recap ‘la’ ‘uh’. So…so in according to timeline, you saw Saifuddin go inside first. Then only once. Follow by Luqman went in 2 occasion, in 2021 alright. You have any question?  "" ...
"" ...
OK ‘uh’ so I continue.

Bearing in mind that she was about that  "" ... and such she can feel. So why is Jannah saying that you put your finger inside her vagina? While you’re saying you didn’t, just put outside.
From what I remember is that I just put outside.
From what you know ‘la’. OK. But the question is that why is she saying that you put your finger inside?
Honest I never put my finger inside.

So no issue ‘uh’ the door.
No issue.
OK. ‘Uh’ now I’m going to show you the next picture.
What can you tell me? In relation, if you see there’s a marking A1, B1 ‘ya’.

Slept with her.
OK so yesterday ‘uh’ you led Police to your sister room.
‘Ah’.
And then…and then you told us your position.
‘Mm’.
‘Ah’ when you do those acts on her right? So the…based on what you say, we have placed the card at A1 and B3 on the bed. So I need you to explain to us today, under the video, what…what meaning is this?
The meaning is that I had touched my sister just beside of me.
‘Huh’?
I slept beside…
You are where? Where is she?
‘Oh’ I was…

OK. So you are B3. Your position is B3.

So you’re, you…you what, on the 4 occasion is it in the same position like this?
Yes.
So can you t…tell us in ‘uh’ sequence when you…before you get to lie, before you get to the bed. How…how you end up at this position?
First ‘uh’ I was playing with my phone.
‘Uh’ ‘huh’.
Then…then after that, play with my phone. I got asked her ‘ah’.
You playing your phone on her bed…
‘Ya’.
…in her room with her?
Like playing with my…Maisarah.
‘Mm’, ‘hm’.
Like tickle her all.
‘Mm’, ‘hm’.
‘Ya’ play with my phone. Then after that ‘uh’ start to touch her  "" ...
Start to what?
Touch her.
Touch Jannah? OK. So…
And while everyone being out.
…‘huh’?
While everyone being out. Like Nurul ‘eh’ Jihan and Maisarah.
So on those 4 occasion, only you and Jannah is inside the room? And then you are lying…this is the same position for all 4 incidences?
Yes, Sir.
You lie next to her. Then she will lie face…she lie face up or face down?
Same ‘ah’. Like this.
She face ceiling or face the bed?
Ceiling.
‘Oh’ so that’s where you told us you will grab her breasts with both hands. And then you put your third and fourth finger and just rub in circle on her vagina ‘la’. Over her underwear ‘ah’. So this are the same for the 4 right?
‘Ya’.
OK.
So all these 4 times, she’s awake ‘la’. And then she’s playing her phone too ‘la’?
Yes, Sir.
Then on the second and fourth occasion, she told you your…while you are touching her vagina, she told you your finger…your finger went in and then you took it out ‘la’.
Yes. Then from there I stop. Never do anymore.
OK. So the other picture is also similar to this, is just the close up.
That’s the close up view, ‘ya’.  "" ... you explain.
OK ‘ah’ now, so that’s all for these photos.
So I move on to my questions, ‘ya’. You need a break? I have only ‘uh’…
‘Ya’.
…5 question more before I finish.
OK.
Shall we finish it? Can? So ‘uh’ so all the time you confirm she is alone in the room, yes?
Yes.
"" ... and then…
…OK. So when before these 4 occasion ‘ah’, when you enter her room, was her door unlocked or not?
Was unlocked like open ‘ah’.
OK but the door was open?
‘Ah’ the door was open. Because I do like very quick one.
OK. Now…
…we were told that…
…‘uh’ Jannah ‘ah’, cannot lock door one. She lock door, she will be scolded. What can you tell us about this?
‘Ah’?
So we…we were told that Jannah at home, she can’t lock her door. If she do, she will be scolded by her family members.
I mean like she…
What can you tell me about it?
…‘oh’ because of that because ‘uh’ at one time, I get, I caught her ‘uh’. Because she send someone photo, like nudes ‘uh’.
‘Huh’?
Like nudes.
What’s that?
Like ‘tsk’ send other people her breasts all  "" ... I get caught ‘ah’.
When was this?
It’s like can’t remember ‘uh’ but I…
How old were you?
16 ‘uh’.
So now you are 19. So 3 years ago?
‘Ah’ 16.
OK 2019. ‘Ya’ tell us more. You caught her sending her nude…her nude photo to other people.
‘Ah’ then ‘uh’ ‘ya’ I said to her ‘uh’ you don’t close the door ‘uh’.
What is this got to do with closing of door ‘leh’? Of her not able to close the door ‘leh’, I don’t understand.
Like she sometimes all day on the phone like when people asked her to do housework, then she just ignore. And when like if I caught her this one, I say to her ‘uh’, like if you do again, ‘uh’ I will tell my mum ‘la’. To mum ‘la’.
So if I get you correctly ‘ah’, what you are trying to say is you have told her not to lock her door as well. You have told her not to lock her door.
‘Ya’.
Because you caught her once in 2019 when she send a nude to her friend. And then you don’t want her to lock door so that you can…you can make sure she don’t do this again? Is that what you are saying?
Like  "" ... observe her like that.
‘Huh’?
Like observe her don’t do like…
You can monitor her ‘la’.
Monitor her.
As a elder brother ‘la’. Alright, that’s your reason for telling her not to lock the door, OK. OK. Alright ‘uh’…
…so, given the fact that your brothers are here. ‘Uh’ was there any discussion about…was there any plan or any discussion among you all brothers to do this to her, Jannah?
No, Sir.
OK. Is that all you can say? You, you…you know but you knew that Saifuddin and Luqman is doing something to your sister. And then…
But I just keep quiet only ‘la’, I never say anything ‘uh’.
…‘ya’. So from your timeline, from your timeline, you are telling us that you first saw Saifuddin going in.
‘Mm’.
You suspect something sexual. And then followed by Luqman. You saw him doing it. And that time, you haven’t do yet. And then you started it yourself. Is that right?
Yes.
So, and this happened without any communication among you 3? Right?
No.
So was there a day that got more than 1 brothers are inside the room?
No we…we all alone.
‘Huh’?
No, we alone.
How you know alone?
Because we never had…
You need to coordinate ‘uh’ then it is your time alone what.
…because we…because we never coordinate like once do once like one shot. Is like own time, own target ‘uh’. Something like that.
Your own time, time target may not be the same as my own time, own target ‘ma’. If let’s say my own time and your own time are same, then we will meet each other in the room ‘ma’. That’s what I’m trying to tell you. Is there any coordination?
No ‘ah’, no, no coordination.
OK. Was there any ‘uh’ exchange of messages among the brothers of this?
No. I rarely message my brothers.

No.
You…you have now nothing to say ‘uh’?
I got ‘uh’ but not…not relevant ‘uh’.
Not relevant to the case…
Like, like, like…
…not rele…not related to Jannah and the brother, yes.
Not related but it’s like…
OK you can say it out.
…because like is 3 years ago.
‘Uh’?
I mean like I’ve been controlling myself for past 2 years ago.
Control yourself from what? From…
Doing this ‘la’.
Doing sexual stuff ‘la’.
Doing sexual stuff by working everyday. By helping my family, give out my family money, sometimes. When my payment come. Then after that, then this happened ‘ah’. That’s all I can say ‘ah’.

OK? “I’m known as Daniel and I understand and prefer to speak in English. My highest education level is N Level. I am currently staying at Block 518B, Tampines Central 7, unit 04-62, with my wife and 2 children. I am currently working as a private hirer for Grab and Gojek since 2019. I’m currently driving a Honda Vezel, silver colour, since June 2021 and it is a
rental car from Grab.” Is that correct so far?
Yes.
“On 6th April 2022, between 8.50pm to 9pm, I met into an accident along Woodlands Avenue 12, and I came to Sengkang Neighbourhood Police Centre to lodge a road traffic accident report after I went to the Sengkang General Hospital to check for injuries on the 7th April 2022. I felt pain on my neck and both knee due to the accident. I passed the Police Officer my phone to show the accident’s photo. And I think he saw photos and videos of a naked woman as he told me he found something illegal on my phone and asked me to explain.” Is that correct so far?
Yes.
“Sometime this year, I remembered picking up a lady from a HDB location at wee hours and I cannot remember the destination. When I arrived at that destination, I turned around to call the lady who was seated at the rear passenger seat and, and she moved her body and I thought she will wake up. And I turned my body back to face the front. However, after a while, there was no response from her and I turned to the back again. And I used my hand to hold onto her hand to shake and wake her up. But no response from her.” Is that correct?
Yes.
“I then waited for a while, and in between, I tried to wake her up a few times. I tried to wake her a few times but she still did not wake up. At that point of time, she was wearing a white coloured dress which I find it sexy and I felt curious.”
Is that correct?
Yes.
“I then turned my body around and I pulled down her dress from the top, exposing her breasts. She was not wearing any bra. I then used my phone to take pictures.” Is that correct?
Yes.
“I then lift up her dress and she was wearing a shorts and I took photos as well. After a while...”
“...I stepped out of my driver’s seat, and went to the rear passenger seat. I was feeling nervous and shivering because I am afraid that she will wake up.” Is that correct?
Yes.
“I quickly pulled down her shorts and I sh...saw her vagina. And I think I did took photos of it. After that, I used my left hand and I inserted I think 1 finger into her vagina and at the same time, I’m taking video using my phone.” Is that correct?
Yes.
“I was moving my finger in and out of her vagina but I’m not sure for how long because I was nervous as there are people walking past before I did it. I then removed my finger from her vagina and pulled up her shorts. I then ran back to my front driver seat. I was watching Youtube and after a while, she woke up. And I told her that the fare... I... and I told her the fare, and she paid in cash.” Is that correct?
Yes.
“After that, she opened the door and left. Before I did the act, I made sure nobody was walking past. I wish to add that after she boarded my car, she made a few calls and she spoke in Vietnamese and Mandarin. She also talked a lot and leaning very close to me. And I told her to lean back because I was driving.” Is that correct?
Yes.
“She also said a few times “I love you.” And I reply back “yes, yes, I love you. Please lean back so that you won’t fall.” A few times.” Is that correct?
Yes.
OK so ‘uh’ Mr Daniel, can you tell us ‘uhm’ a bit about your background? I mean ‘uhm’ your, your, your wife. You are staying with your wife and your, your chil... how old is your children, other than that?

I’m not quite sure. Because I didn’t talk to her.
OK. OK. Can you tell us more about your job? And before you were driving, what were you doing?
‘Orh’ before I was driving, I was working as a ‘uh’ import and export ‘uh’ coordinator in a local company. So until they sold it, I think in twen... 2016 ‘ah’. They sold it to a China company and then they shifted the whole ‘uh’ operation to ‘uh’ Jurong. So but because I’m staying in Tampines so I... we don’t want to travel so much so I resigned from there.
So... OK so before you ‘uh’ worked as a private hirer...

‘Uh’.
‘Ya’ because I’m trying to find...
‘Ya’. ‘Ya’ trying to find a job.

‘Ya’ because ‘uh’... because earlier on when she came into my car when she talked, so I find it very ‘uh’ sedu... seductive, seductive to me.
OK. So when she  ... You... You are
saying that when she boarded your car...
Because the way that she  ...
...she was very seductive?
...and then she was right ‘uh’ behind on my ear  ...
Sorry because the way what?
Because she seated behind me and her face is very close to my ear, ear.
OK.
So she’s... she would... she’s seated behind you...
‘Ya’.
...and she was leaning very...
She leaning ‘uh’ ‘uh’...
...close to your ear?
...close to my ear and then...
OK.
...talk, talk to me. ‘Ya’.
What did she talk to you?
A, a lot of thing didn’t make sense but ‘uh’ she said many times “I love you.” And she also said she want to drink and then asked me ‘uh’ to bring her to, to go and drink.
OK.
So ‘ya’, then, then ‘uh’ I will say “‘Ah’ OK, OK. ‘Uh’ now is too late already. ‘Uh’ I will bring you home first. We will drink some other time.”  ... So is just to... just, just to  ...
So she said things like “I love you” and she wanted to drink and asked you to bring her to drink?
‘Uh’ ‘ya’ she wanted to go for a drink.
OK. Then what you told her?
Then I, I told her “Yes, yes.” and then ‘uhm’ ‘uh’ “Some other day because ‘uh’ now the time to go back because it’s very late already.” So something like that.
Why do you... why, why, why did you tell her this?
Because she wanted to drink what. And then he book... she book the cab, supposed to go home right? And then she was telling me that, that she want to drink. ‘Uh’ “Let’s go for a drink”, things like that. Then a, a lot other thing, I could not remember but it, it doesn’t make sense. So just to... like she said ‘uh’ “I love you.” I’ll return, I will say, “OK, I, I love you also so just sit back.” and just to, just to so called play along with her ‘la’. So hopefully she’s convinced and then...
So all these thing you find it seductive?
‘Uh’ the way that she talked to me, talk in my back ‘la’. So...
OK. And how do you feel about that?
You mean now or then?
Then, then.
Then. ‘Uh’ because when she was always talking to me, so I’m just trying to calm her and then ask her to sit down, just to bring her home. So that, that is the intention. So that time I, I don’t have in mind that she’s going to fall asleep and that she cannot wake up. So, so that time is just to calm her down.
So your intention is to calm, calm her down and...
‘Ya’. And go back.
...and send her home?
Yes.
And you didn’t expect her to fall asleep?
Yes.
OK. Carry on.
‘Uh’ so that, that, that’s then ‘la’, what, what I’m thinking.

Just to, just to, just to enjoy ‘lor’.
What do you mean by enjoy?
‘Uh’ just that I can masturbate or like that.
So, so that... you took, you took all these photos and videos so that ‘uh’ you can watch it as and when you want when you are
masturbating?
‘Mm’.
Is that what you said?
Yes.
So do you, do you recall where did you pick her up?
No couldn’t. Because the  ... Picture is that it’s a HDB carpark. HDB carpark is, is... the parking is all standard one.
OK.
So she’s standing in the middle with a guy beside her. So that’s all I, I know.
OK so what you could recall is that you picked her up at a HDB location?
A carpark.
Carpark.
Yes.
And a guy was beside her?
‘Uh’ not very close. Not standing side by side. So pro... probably 2 metres away.
OK.
But obviously they are together ‘la’. I mean from far when I approached her. So in my thought that ‘uh’ OK, I’m picking up a couple ‘la’.
OK can you tell us in details from the time you, you reached the location and what happened?
So when I reached the location, ‘uh’ the lady come forward, but then the man retrieved. I, I can’t remember whether she... he... she walked by the side or walked backward to where the other cars is.
What do you mean?
So only the girls came forward.
‘Orh’ so only the girl...
‘Ah’.
...came forward to your car?
‘Ya’. So when she enter... so I expecting the other door to be open and close but didn’t so when I look, looked at the side, she, he was standing next to a car.
So you...
So I don’t know whether is it his car or somebody’s car. But he just standing there.
So you, so you mean you were expecting...
Of course, because 2 person ‘ma’.
...‘uh’ 2 passengers?
‘Ya’.
Is that what you trying to say?
‘Uh’ ‘ya’. Because they are, they are there. To me, they are, they are waiting ‘ma’.
So end up is only the lady...
The lady.
...who board the car?
‘Ya’.
Your car?
‘Ya’.
Right?
Yes.
So, so can you remember what private hire application was that?
I, I cannot remember because ‘uh’ sometimes I turn on 2, so whichever book, then I just switch off the other one.
So you cannot remember?
So I, I really cannot remember.
So it’s either Gojek or Grab?
Yes.
Because you are only...
‘Yup’ only 2 platform.
...only do these 2... 2 platform. And no other platform, am I right?
No, no other platform.
OK so from the point she boarded your car, tell us what did you observe of... what was your observation of her?
‘Uh’ because once she aboard, then I’m trying to see whether the guy come in or not. So confirm that she’s alone. Then as usual I say OK, the location to her.
Sorry?
I don’t know whether she, she replied me or not. Usually I... we will have to tell customer their location that they are going to.
That means you have to inform...
‘Ya’.
...that... the passenger...
‘Uh huh’. That this is...
...where they are heading to?
Yes.
OK so, so...
If, if this... if, if I pick a wrong person, so he... she should say “‘Oh’ no this is not a correct location ‘la’.”
OK.
So but if she didn’t say anything, so we presume that OK this is...
So what did you do for... on that instance? I mean when she boarded.
As, as usual.
OK.
And start, and then ‘uh’ activate the map, ‘uh’ the, the...
So did you told, told her the location that she’s going?
Of course, I did told her the, the location. ‘Ya’.
Was there any response from her?
I can’t remember whether she... because once she enter already, she start talking already. But I still have to tell her what.  So...
You remember what she... you remember what she said when she first entered your vehicle?
First word I can’t remember. But because a, a lot of words doesn’t make sense to me.
Doesn’t make sense to you.
‘Ah’.
OK. So other than that, what, what’s your observation of her?
‘Uh’ when?
The moment she boarded your car.
‘Oh’ she...
...talk ‘lor’. She talk, talk, talk non-stop.
OK.
‘Ah’. That is when I know that  ...
And you said that it doesn’t make sense. Why is that so?
She, she talk about drinking, then other thing which I can’t... I... I... I’m not able to understand what she’s talking about.
OK.
Although she speak in Mandarin.
She speak to you in Mandarin?
‘Ya’ she... I, I... Because she talk to me ‘ah’ because I’m the only one in front of her.
But you cannot make sense of what she said?
‘Ya’. Cannot.  ...  Even though she say she want to drink, so it’s like ‘uh’... then af... ‘uh’ I mean to, to me, she’s already drunk ‘la’ the way that she talk right. I mean she still want to drink, that means confirm that she...
OK. So you mentioned that ‘uh’ the way she talked, she’s already drunk. What do you mean?
‘Uh’ when a drunkard speak, they don’t, they don’t speak very clearly right? I mean to me ‘la’.
OK.
‘Ya’.
So other than not speaking clearly, were there any other observations that you noticed?
‘Oh’ ‘ya’ ‘la’ then she moved, moved towards me ‘la’. So I was wondering ‘uh’ why... ‘oh’ because she came from the left door. She came from the left door.
OK.
So I expect that the other guy come from the right back door. Because she  ...
She came, she came in from the left door.
‘Ya’.
OK.
And then after that she, she go forward to the middle because my 2 front seat right, so she was in the middle. Then they later... then after talking, talking, then she come ‘uh’ over to my ear. Then she actually shifted to...
OK so she came in...
...my side.
...she lean towards you.
‘Ya’.
‘Ya’ so ‘uh’ but you mentioned that ‘uhm’... what do you mean by she, she’s, she’s drunk? Other than she speaking ‘uh’ talking to you things that doesn’t make sense? Other than that, any...
‘Uh’ through, through her movement, through her talking ‘lor’.
Through her talking.
Then you are able to gauge that OK she’s drunk.
OK.
‘Ya’.
So is she, is she reek of alcohol?
Can’t remember because I was wearing mask.
So you can’t?
I, I can’t tell whether she  ...
But to you she looks drunk?
Yes. And, and when, when, when my vehicle moved towards her where she’s standing, ‘uh’ she’s talking to the other guy also.
OK.
So the other guy was looking at, at her but I, I can’t hear what they are talking about ‘la’.
So when you driving towards her  ...
Then she... when she talk then her hand  ...like everywhere. ‘Ya’.
So that’s also a sign for you ‘la’?
...
That she’s drunk ‘la’?
‘Ya’ so I thought that this guy is ‘uh’ accompany her home or something like that because only 1 destination.
OK.
So do you ‘uh’ recall where did you drop her off?
‘Oh’ I can’t. Really can’t. Because it is dark. I, I actually follow the ‘uh’ app, the application app. So how ‘uh’ ‘uh’ that, that’s what usually I do ‘la’.
OK ‘uh’...
Just, just follow ‘lor’.
Not exactly where but can you remember the area that you drop off?
‘Uh’ what I could think of is probably near Geylang. Geylang area. Because there’s shophouse, shophouse where there’s a lot of shop ‘la’ but ‘uh’ I’m going, I’m going by the back.
‘Ah’.
That’s why I don’t see the shophouse front. I see the shophouse back.
So is...
...you assume, assume that it’s somewhere near Geylang?
‘Ya’.
As you will drive...
‘Ya’.
...you drive past shophouses?
Because, because when... if I enter and then the shophouse is on my right, and then there are fence, and then there are some apartments over my left side.
OK so back to the location where you pick her up ‘ah’, ‘uh’ although you cannot remember... OK?
It is only a carpark.
‘Ya’. But can you remember the area? Is it north, south, east, west?
No.
Can you remember? You cannot remember?
Cannot. Because all the carpark looks alike. And, and before that, where am I, I, I also couldn’t remember. Because sh...
But 1 thing you can remember is that you dropped her off somewhere near Geylang?
‘Uh’ why I said Geylang, I think that is the more suitable vibe thing ‘la’. I mean because you are asking me right, ‘uh’ ‘uh’ what, what I think right? So what, what I think. But whether... how close to Geylang, I, I’m not very sure.
OK. OK.
If I... ‘uh’ if we bring you back to Geylang area, can you direct us to...
...the place?
I don’t think so. Because that one is night and I follow the app. So now if, if you say that I follow your instruction or you ask me to try to find my way, definitely I don’t think so. ‘Ya’. That’s why what happened like yesterday, this morning I, I couldn’t find my car for 5 hours.
‘Mm’.
Are we able to retrieve the... from your application, the location where you pick up and the location where you drop off?
‘Oh’ that one I’m not quite sure because this one is under the application.
You are not sure?
So...
As a user of the application, you are not sure ‘la’...
No.
...whether this can be done or not?
Because we, we, we, we are told not to ‘uh’ copy  ... ‘Ya’. Like the address ‘la’.
So if, if you are able to access your app...
‘Ah’.
...OK, and there will be booking history right?
‘Uh’.
Will there be booking history?
Yes. But ‘uh’ usually is the amount ‘la’. Amount.
The amount.
‘Ya’.
Will, will the location be shown there?
I... There is a location but I do not know that location is it a starting point or the ending point.
OK.
‘Ah’. No idea.
So if you, if you are able to access the app and will you be able to find out the... on that day itself, where did you go to?
‘Uh’ unless the app can pinpoint that location ‘la’.
OK which you are not sure as of now...
‘Ah’.
...because you don’t have the, the phone with full address?
‘Uhm’ no. ‘Uh’ I, I think they should have the full address but the question is that ‘uh’ is it a starting point or the end, end, end point. That one I don’t know.
OK. Don’t know whether it will be... is, is it the pickup point...
‘Ah’.
...or the ending point.
Ending point. Correct.
OK so if I were to...
...try to jolt your memory ‘ah’, do you remember what time was that? Roughly when you pickup and what time did you drop her off?
No. Cannot. Because once the booking come, we will... we, we don’t look at the time. We just quickly go to the destination. Otherwise they will start to chase you, ‘uh’ “What time are you arriving? Are you on the way or not?” That, that’s what they do.
What shift are you doing?
That time I can’t remember what time I start.
What shift do you normally drive? The day shift or the night shift?
Both ‘ah’ actually.
‘Mm’?
Both.
So...
So as and when if...
...when, when you decide you doing day shift, when you decide to do night shift?
...‘oh’ if I’m not tired... if I’m not tired, then I will, I, I will... I can drive longer hours. Or if I in financial need, I need more cash, then I will drive more hours.
OK so there’s no... nothing fixed ‘la’?
‘Ah’ no, there’s no fixed. Or unless I’m very tired ‘lor’. So if... even though if I have a preferred time, but after 1, 2 trip, if I’m tired, ‘uh’ I will go and sleep. Because if I’m tired, I can’t drive. So even my sleep got no timing.
So in, in your Contemporaneous Statement, you said that he... she paid you in cash.
‘Uh’ yes. Before  ...
OK can you remember, can you remember how much she paid you?
I think is around 18 or something but that’s all I can recall.
About 18 dollars?
But, but is there any cents or not, I, I, I can’t...
You can’t remember. But according...
She pay, she pay me exactly where I did not have to return.
So you did not return...
I, I did not return.
You did not have, have to...
‘Ah’. No need.
...return any change to her?
‘Ah’. No, no return change.
OK but what you could recall is that is about 18 dollar?
‘Ya’ that’s what I can think of.
OK. So when you reached the location, and when you did the act, so in between did you shift your car to anywhere?
‘Uh’ no. When I stopped there, it’s where she’s supposed to alight.
OK so you... when you stopped there, it’s where she’s supposed to alight.
‘Mm’.
You did not, you did not shift your car to anywhere else...
No. No.
...before you did the act?
No. ‘Ya’.
OK.
OK ‘uh’ Mr Daniel, I have nothing to ask you ‘uh’ as of now. Do you have anything else you wish to add to this interview?
Yes.
OK.
I would like to add ‘uhm’ af…after filming, I did try to ‘uh’ see
the video once ‘ah’ and I thought...
...that I can just masturbate. ‘Uh’ but then it doesn’t work. So after that I have the intention to erase it ‘uh’ but I did not erase during that viewing. So...
OK I stop you here ‘ah’?
‘Ah’.
So you mentioned that ‘uh’ after filming, you tried to view the video.
Not immediate.
Not immediate.
Not immediate. After a few days passed.
‘Uh’ where did you try to view it?
‘Uh’ in, in, in my car ‘la’.
In your car?
‘Ya’ in my car.
OK.
Because I seldom home what. I’m, I’m always out.
So you tried to view it ‘uh’...
In the car.
...some... a few days later.
‘Ya’.
In your car.
‘Mm’.
And you tried to masturbate... view... by viewing the video...
‘Ya’.
...but it doesn’t work?
‘Ya’ it doesn’t work.
What do you mean by it doesn’t work?
‘Uh’ it doesn’t arose... it, it doesn’t excite me.
It doesn’t excite you.
‘Ah’  ...
OK. And...
So because my intention is that I can keep it and I can view it so that I can, I can masturbate. So but after that viewing, I regretted that I, I, I shouldn’t have even done that because it, it doesn’t
help at all.
So ‘uh’ what do you think? I mean ‘uh’ why, why does... why it doesn’t, doesn’t work at all?
‘Uh’ maybe because ‘uh’ I don’t have this experience before. I thought that ‘uh’ this one will... that having this, I will able to enjoy myself ‘la’ be, because I, I don’t have a life.
Yes.
‘Ah’ so...
So is there a reason why you did not, you did not... in that... the video doesn’t excites you?
‘Oh’ I, I don’t know. When I see... probab…
So what were you feeling when you see the video?
Quite disappointed.
‘Uh’ in what sense?
Quite disappointed and in a sense that I, I shouldn’t because... ‘ya’.
So you are disappointed...
‘Uh’ it, it doesn’t help me and then on the other hand, ‘uh’ I know that this is illegal and I had done something wrong.
OK.
So...
So what... why, why, why do you think that you have done something wrong?
‘Uh’ this, this is another person. So...
Sorry?
It is, is a lady.
OK.
So I’m doing something which without her consent.
OK.
And then ‘uh’ I’m taking advantage of her.
‘Ya’.
So you did something wrong because by doing this without her consent and, and ‘uh’ taking advantage of her?
‘Ya’. While, while she...
And that’s why you are disappointed? You are disappointed?
‘Uh’ myself.
With yourself?
That I shouldn’t even do this... such a thing.
And you shouldn’t even be doing this.
Yes.
Is that correct?
‘Ya’. So I could imagine if, if, if she’s my daughter, will I do that thing.
OK. OK Mr Daniel, ‘uh’ is there anything else you need to add before we conclude the statement?
‘Uh’ the, the... when, when I took the video that time, I, I, I am very, very nervous.
OK.
‘Uh’ because I have never videoed ‘uh’ such before. So ‘uh’ in my heart, is that ‘uh’ there’s, there’s a war on making such decision. 1 side that says that ‘uh’ ‘uh’ afterall is only video and then it is, is just for yourself to watch. So you are not going to send, you are not going to expose her, not going to do anything else so it, it should be fine. But on the other end, then it says that ‘uh’ should not because it’s illegal. I know that
... it is illegal.  ...
OK so, so what you trying to say is that ‘uh’ ‘uhm’ 1... on 1 hand, you... is, is telling you that it’s just a video, it’s fine, it’s alright. And on the other hand, ‘uh’...
‘Ya’.
...telling yourself it’s, it’s illegal and ‘uh’ you shouldn’t be doing this.
What I’m trying to say that ‘uh’ when I took... when I intend to took the video that time, I did struggle. That’s why I told you that ‘uh’ I am ‘uh’...
...
...nervous, nervous. So all these thing come, come into me.
OK.
‘Ya’.
OK. Anything else?
So, so during that time, I’m, I’m, I’m, I’m really frightened. Very frightened.
You are frightened of what?
Anything going to happen.
Like what?
Like I say, if somebody pass by, if she wake up and shout at me, ‘uh’ if I got caught.
You are afraid that someone walk past and saw what you did?
Or if someone, someone ‘uh’ or if I lost my phone, and then someone pick up my phone. ‘Uh’ so that, that went into my nervousness.
So you mentioned that you intend to erase it but...
Yes.
...why didn’t you do it?
‘Uh’ I think because ‘uh’ after seeing it doesn’t help, then I, I switched to ‘uh’ Goog search. Google search ‘ah’ immediately.
What do you mean?
‘Uh’ to, to watch porn online.
‘Orh’ so immediately when, when you watched the video, it didn’t help you, it doesn’t excite you at all, you, you switched to searching on Google for pornography?
‘Ya’.
And that’s when you masturbated yourself?
Yes. I think so I did masturbate. I, I think so.
OK. OK ‘uhm’ anything else Mr Daniel?
‘Uh’ I, I regretted my actions.
OK.
And I know that I will cause my family ‘uh’ shameless. And
then ‘uh’...
So you regretted your action, you... because...
Yes. Especially ‘uh’ my son...
OK.
...because I always remind him not to do anything ‘uh’ illegal.
OK.
So now I got nothing to say because I myself got caught.
OK.
So I do not know how to face my son now.
OK.
Or rather my daughter also, my daughter respect me... I... my daughter respected me as a father also.
OK.
So with this action, I think she will be very very disappointed.
OK so you are just saying, you saying that your children will be disappointed ‘la’ right?
Yes.
OK. ‘Uh’ we hear you. ‘Uhm’ anything else?
Can’t think of  ...
Sorry?
I, I can’t think of anything else.  ... Say already.
So nothing else as of now ‘la’ right?
I wish I could say more because... but I, I, I, I, I can’t bring out the hurt and to express the hurt so all I can say is I’m very, very sorry.
OK. You are very, very sorry. OK. Can. ‘Uhm’...
‘Ya’.
...anything else before we conclude the statement? Anything else before we conclude?
I can’t think of anything to say.
So I’ll conclude the statement now?
OK.
Time now is 9:54.
OK.  Today is 8 March 2022.  The time now is 7.50pm.  OK, ‘eh’ greetings to you.  How do I address you?

‘Mm’.
So…
So when we went there, I said that you sure you want to go to my house.  Let me check whether there is anybody at home or not.
Why do you ask… why do you say that?
So if there is people at my house, I cannot bring anybody in.  So if only there is nobody at home then I can bring her back.

Then I say there’s nobody outside ‘meh’.
Then she said that the other people are working.  Should be going home very late.
So let me stop you and ask you ‘ah’ at the point in time, do you expect someone to be in the house.
Because at that time I thought that if there is somebody at home and she brings me up it wouldn’t be good also.
Because I don’t know whether she can bring people back to the house or not.

She only told me that her roommate is not at home then she bring me up.
OK.  Can, understand now.  Go on.  From there…

After taking the drink, I asked her where is the room.
Then she pointed towards the room and then she opened the door for me to go in.
Did you ask to go to the room?
No.
I only asked her which room is hers.
OK.  After that.
Then she told me this one.
‘Mm’.
Then I went in with her.
After you go in ‘uh’ was the room door opened or closed?
Should be closed.
‘Mm’.  ‘Uh’ who closed the door?

Even nearer.
Closer. OK, can. ‘Uh’ was she…covering herself with anything?
‘Mm’…
Or was she just in her…

I think she was holding on to a jacket or something, I’m not sure.
OK. Are you sure that she was not just in her top and shorts but there was something covering her?
If you cannot remember, can…you can just say you cannot…
.
.
‘Tsk’, ‘mm’… .

OK. So going back to the…conversation, ‘uh’ she was talking about her past bad relationships she has, ‘uh’ how do you react?
…

‘Mm’.
…  ‘lor’.
I just talked to her about some things.
Like what?
So I told her like, want to be in a relationship just be friends with that person first, don’t immediately…don’t accept the person too quickly.

Because previously she mentioned that she tend to accept people quite quickly.
‘Mm’. What about your…body reaction?

Not much reaction. Just like that.
OK. So…then tell me what happened after that?
OK.
OK. So as we were chatting then I was closer to her.
OK.
.
She also didn’t have anything.
What do you mean by…   …getting closer?
.
I will move forward.
How do you move forward?
Because you were seated.
‘Mm’.
‘Uh’… .
…
Like nearer.
OK. ‘Mm’. Then after that?
.
.
Then hugged.
How do you hugged her?
.
Like 2 person like that hug.
How did she react to your hug?
.
.

No reaction, am I right to say that she did not hug you back? Yes or No?
.
‘Eh’, sorry.
VRI.
‘Mm’…
‘Uh’ I don’t think so.
‘Mm hm’.
OK. So…
…what happened after the hug?
OK.
…then… .
Then I touched her private part.
How did you touch her private part? How did you transit from hugging to touching her private part?
OK.  …
…
‘Ya’. .
How?
… ‘lor’.
Like hugged already then used hand to touch her private part.
OK. So I want to know more details on…how you moved your hand and how your hand or fingers go in…go to her private part.
OK…
For example you are hugging her like that, then how did it go over?
OK  …
…
Because another hand was hugging her…
‘Mm’.
…so the other go and touch.
So which hand was hugging her and which hand was touching her?
OK. .
. Right hand was touching her.
OK. Did you touch her over her clothes or…inside the clothes?
.
.
‘Hm’?
.
She was wearing her…
‘Mm’.
…bottoms, haven’t removed.
OK. So how do you touch her? Was your hand over her clothes or did you…did your hands go into her shorts?
.
‘Uh’… …then… i…‘lor’.
Pulled her shorts to one side and then touched her.
OK. Which part of the shorts did you pull to one side?
OK. .
‘Uh’…
So, for example ‘huh’, shorts is like that…
…did you go through here to pull out…‘uh’ from here or from the leg…  ?
.
The bottom.
The bottom. ‘Uh’…left side or right side?
Right side.
OK. You pulled open her shorts, what about her panties?
.
Should be not wearing.
OK. ‘Uh’…why would you say that she should not be wearing her panties?
.
.
Based on what I can recall, when I pulled to a side, I only remember there wasn’t any panties, only her shorts.
.
OK. So, I’m not sure whether she got wear or not but then she was wearing like, if you…if she lifted up her legs, you will see…you can see her body parts already.
Did you see her body parts?
.
If she…
.
If she lifted up a bit, can see a bit of her body parts.
So you’re saying if, so, is that what you are assuming?
OK.
Have you actually see it?
.
.
I saw.
.
I saw when she lifted.
…
…jacket…
Because her jacket was putting on the top part only.
Then…
And for this part was open.
And…
.
OK.
So when she was sitting like that, she only covering the top part. So the other parts can be seen.
So what did you actually see?
.
.
See the side.
Side…   …
Like not wearing panties like that.
OK. Did you see the vagina?
.
No.
OK. So, s…it’s ‘uh’ …the vagina area ‘la’. The… . How do you say…
Groin.
‘Ya’, groin area ‘la’.
.
‘Ah’. .
‘Ya’.
OK. Can. So now let’s talk about ‘uh’ you touching her vagina.
You mentioned that it was through her leg hole. ‘Uh’…how did you touch her vagina?
.
.
Pulled the shorts to one side.
OK. So, what I mean is do you…   … ‘uh’ rubbed outside or do you insert your fingers inside her vagina?
.
.
Insert inside.
How many fingers did you insert in?
.
.
1.
OK. What did you do when you insert your finger inside? Do you move it? For example do you move in and out? Do you stay there or…   …
…‘la’, .
‘Huh’?
…
…
I don’t think I go in a lot. All the way to her private part.
Because I was only at outside area only.
I’m also not very sure it went in or not.
How much did your finger go in?
.
.
Should be not everything go in.
So… ‘uh’…
.
…show me which part.
About half ‘ah’. OK. .
…‘la’.
About half.
OK. So this is…your finger.
‘Ya’.
You will point to me which part go in.
.
About this.
So, for the record about 2 sections.
‘Ya’.
And not all the way.
When you say didn’t go in as in not the whole finger go in but part of it go in, am I right to say that.
‘Ya’.
After that I think she stood up.
OK. So, the moment that your finger go in, ‘uh’ what did you do with the finger?
OK.  …
…
.
Touched.
You can, you can demonstrate.
.
.
Touched.
So you do that.
‘Ah’ ‘ya’.
Or do you go in and out?
.
‘Uh’…
Just do like that. Never go in and out.
So at that moment, how did she react?
‘Mm’…
She say don’t want, don’t want.
But she didn’t push me away or anything.
In what tone or in what manner did she say she don’t want?
.
.
Like very normal ‘la’.
Like say ‘ah’ don’t want ‘ah’, don’t want ‘ah’, like that.
OK. When you do that, did she…actually do that? Because just now you are like…in the statement you, you gesture this way.
.
.
Like…
I think she didn’t use her hands because she had something on her…
‘Mm’.
…so she should be just shaking her head say don’t want, don’t want.
OK. How…what is the voice level that she used?
.
‘Mm’…
Not very loud.
…
She wasn’t very loud at that time.
So, after you heard her say don’t want, don’t want, ‘uh’…what did you do?
…
… ... ‘lor’…
…
When she say don’t want, don’t want, then I removed…   …I take out the whole thing.
So to clarify, you…do you take out part of your finger or do you remove the whole finger?
OK. Removed the whole finger because I only used 1 finger.
OK, I removed already, then she stood up.
OK. And what happened after that…after this?
… then…  …‘lor’.
She stood up already then I put in again.
OK. And what did you do with your finger after you put in?
.
‘Mm’… .
The same
‘Mm’. And what did she do?
Like want to leave like that.
‘Mm hm’.
Describe more what do you mean by she wants to leave?
‘Uh’…  …
…
She didn’t like leave very violently but she was like wanting to leave like that. But then you can just stopped her by holding on to her.
Did you stop her by holding on to her?
I think so.
How do you stop her?
…
I just hold on to her…
….
…like normal like that. Then she never moved.
OK. Which part of her body did you hold on to?
I forgot whether it was a leg or her hand.
OK. Did she say anything at this time?
No. Then after that she say something like don’t want ‘ah’, or something like that.
So…to clarify this is the second time that she say she don’t want, is that correct?
.
‘Mm’.
Yes.
OK. What did you do after she say she…don’t want?
…
…
I continued.
OK.
…
...
OK, I continued then I think she shouted.
What did she shout?
.
‘Eh’ … … ‘la’.
OK. Before she shouted, she slapped me.
OK. Then…after that?
OK. After she slapped me, she shouted.
‘Mm’. What did she shout?
Like just ‘ah’ like that.
‘Mm’. Then what did you do?
Then I stopped.
OK.
Never moved.
OK. You stopped as in you stopped with your fingers still inside her vagina or do you…or what do you mean by stop?
…
…
OK. Because when she slapped me, I already removed my hand already.
‘Mm’. Did she slap you…which part of your body did she slap you?
On the face.
Left face, right face?
S…
Left side. Should be on this sit…side.
On the left.
OK. Can. So after that what happened?
OK.
OK. After she slapped me, she shouted.
‘Mm’.
After shouting, she cried.
‘Mm hm’. Was she still standing up when she was crying?
She sat down when she was crying. She sat down.
‘Mm’.
Then she lifted her legs up and then just leaned like that.
OK. Then what about you? What were you doing?
I moved away from her.
‘Mm’.
Then I told her you don’t cry.
…
…
Then I told her it was an act of impulse.
‘Mm’.
She didn’t respond to me.
…
…
…
She…
…
OK. So she leaned back against the wall and just sit like this and just stared at me quietly.
OK.
And just looked at me and not moving.
…OK…
…I was very…
…I was far away from her and then I told her…
‘Mm’.
…OK, I don’t touch you already. You calm down.
… ‘Mm’.
And then she has stopped crying already and then she just sit there and look at me.
…
‘Mm’.
…
Then I sat at the side.
What do you mean by at her s…at the side?
OK. I was…
…at my original place, so she was at the window.
‘Mm’.
The window there was some…there’s a s…wall there. So she was leaning on the wall. So I was at my original spot.
Am I right to say that she move away from the original spot?
‘Ah’.
Yes.
She was at the wall.
Then I went back to my original spot.
OK. So what happened after that?
Then I sat there.
And then I tell her you don’t think too much.
She didn’t respond.
Then I told her just calm down first.
‘Mm’.
Then she went back to her bed.
‘Mm’.
Then I went…s…stood up…got up and sit beside her bed. At the side of her bed.
Then she didn’t respond to me. She just looked at me like that.
Then I drank my…drink.
Then I waited for a while.
What are you waiting for?
Wait for her to calm down.
Then I wanted to leave already.
‘Mm’, OK. So, how did you, how did you leave? She asked you to leave or you leave on your own?
‘Uh’…  ….
So after she calmed down, maybe about 5 minutes…
…i ‘lor’
…then she told me ‘ah’ you leave first ‘ah’, you go back first.
…OK…  ‘lor’.
And then I told her OK, then I’ll go home then you just rest here.
How did you leave the house?
‘Mm’…
Then she show me out. So I said that I go out then she just follow me.
So… ‘uh’ …she followed you until which part?
The main gate. Main door.
OK.
So, am I right to say that she did not leave the house?
‘Ya’, Correct.
OK. So after you left the house, what happened after that?
She closed the door quite…with quite a lot of force.
‘Mm’. Then what about you?
Then I tell her I leave first.
Then she closed the door.
‘Mm’. OK.
Then…
Then ‘uh’ I called a car.
‘Mm’. So, did you go down on your own?
Yes.
OK.
She didn’t follow.
Where did you go after this?
I went home.
OK. ‘Uh’…did you still chat with her after this incident?
When I went downstairs, we chatted for a while.
What did you talk about?
I cannot remember.
OK. ‘Uh’ do you still have the chat records?
No.
Why not?
OK. ‘Uh’ she said that she deleted me.
She say she deleted you. As in she…how did she say that she deleted you?
OK.  …
So before she deleted me, I sent a message to her but it didn’t get through.  So she deleted already.
What is this message that you, that you did not get through to her?
I cannot remember.
Did you…
But it couldn’t got through.  Didn’t get through.
So she deleted me first.
Then I also deleted her.
OK.  Did you try to reach out to her?
I don’t think so.
OK.  So I have some questions to ask you ‘uh’ with regard to what you have said just now.
So we received information that you have asked her of her views of having sex before officiating a relationship.  What do you have to say?
Mean I ask her.
Yes, yes.
Did you ask her that?
Yes.  I think so.
So what exactly did you ask her?
I cannot remember.
We have information that when you were inside her room with her ‘uh’ when you first hugged her, she actually pushed you away.  What do you have to say?
Before I hugged her, she didn’t push me away
She only started to push me away when I put in my finger.
OK.  Was there anyone else in the house when you were there?
I don’t know whether there is any other person in the house or not because all the doors were closed.  She said there wasn’t anyone else.
OK.  Did you wash your hands after the incident?
Yes.
I asked her where is the toilet.
Then she told me that the toilet beside.
The toilet is inside her room.
How many times did you wash your hands?
Only 1 time.
OK so only 1 time.  I told her that I wanted to go and wash my hands.  She said there is a shampoo there, white coloured one.  Can use that.
Why did you wash your hands?
Because the private part is dirty.
OK.  Just now you mentioned that ‘uh’ she said no.  But and you removed your finger.  Sorry, again ‘ah’.  So she said no.  You removed her finger but after that you still put in her fin, put in your finger into her vagina again.  Why is it so?
I, I myself don’t know also.  Maybe it was impulsive.
Do you think she has allowed you to put your finger into her vagina on both occasions?
Should be not willing.  But then she didn’t like very violently walk away or anything.
OK the feeling she give me was that I could hold on to her because she didn’t use a lot of force to try to walk away.
So if that is the case, why did you still think that she is not willing?
Because she…
She got say don’t want, don’t want.  So I don’t know whether she want or she don’t want.  I also don’t know.
So knowing that she’s not willing, why do you still put your finger into her vagina for the second time?
Second time was also impulsive.  Because I wasn’t sure whether she want or don’t want.
In your past experience how would you…
…know whether a girl wants or don’t want.
Because if she really don’t want then she would have left the room already.
OK.  So to clarify, you mentioned that there was one point in time where she wanted to walk away but you pulled her back.  Is that correct?
So she was standing there.  She wasn’t… she, it wasn’t like she was wanting to leave the room.  She wanted to move towards the bed or towards the wall.  So it was just another direction.
OK.  Was that direction away from you or towards you?
Is a dead end.
No.  My question is whether that direction is towards you or away from you.
Should be away.
What do you understand by that?
Because at that time when I hold onto her hand…
The second time I put my finger into her private part it wasn’t for very long…
Then she give me 1 slap.
After she slapped then I removed my hand.
Why did you think she slap you?
I don’t know.  Maybe I was holding onto her at that time.
What do you think it means by her slapping you?
Maybe ask me to stop.
OK.  We also have information that while fingering her, you pulled down her shorts.  At that point in time she was standing up.  What do you have to say?
Pulling down the shorts I think there was such a thing.  But she didn’t let me pull it down.
So what do you mean?  Do you mean that you try to pull it down or you manage to pull it down somewhere?
OK.  I tried to pull it down.  But I didn’t manage to. She didn’t let me pull it.
So ‘uh’ to clarify, you mean that her shorts were still around the waist area.  You were not able to pull it down.
Didn’t manage to pull down her shorts.
OK.  When after the whole incident, you mentioned that you told her not to think too much.  Why did you, why do you say so?
Because I’m afraid that she will do something silly or cannot think things through properly.
Why would he think this way?
Because I saw that she was crying at that time.
OK.  I am more or less done with this interview.
OK.  Like that time I touch her was because she said that she depend on feeling.
What do you mean by that?
OK because I asked her if I touch you will you be angry or not.
I asked her, previously got people like that touch you then will you get angry or not.
So what did she say?
She said depends on the feeling.
What does it mean to you?
The feeling she give was like you can go and try.
OK because she already said it depends on feeling. She never say that cannot do this.
If she said that she wouldn’t do this then maybe I will respect her.
Because this is not her personality.
And so she said depends.  Then I asked her did you do the same thing with the other guys or something like this.
She said got some.
OK.  I’m more or less done with my interview for this incident.  Do you have anything else you want to add?
Nothing else.
OK.  ‘Uh’ do you know what is a Polygraph Examination?
No.
OK.  So a Polygraph Examination is something similar to the interview that we are having now.  Except that there will be… ‘uh’ it is a test to show whether you are, are likely to have lied or likely to be telling the truth.
This examination is purely by your consent.
OK.  ‘Uh’ even if you consent now, we will review the evidence and decide later on whether to send you for Polygraph Examination.
OK.  Are you willing to go for Polygraph Examination?
I’m OK.
OK.  So later we will let you sign a form after the interview.
So next ‘uh’ do you want ‘uh’ to inform your embassy about this incident?
No.
OK.  Similarly, later we will let you sign on this forms as well.
OK.  So ‘uh’ to ask you again, do you have anything else to add.  If not, we will conclude this interview proper.
No.
OK.  Then ‘uh’ time now is 9.19pm.  We will conclude this interview.
OK, good afternoon Mister Daniel. Ok, I’m ‘uh’ Station Inspector Fauzi. Together with me is my colleague…
…ASP Yap Kai Jia. I’m conducting a police investigation into a case of sexual assault by penetration…
…which was reported yesterday 7 April 2022. The victim in this case is one of your customer, ‘uh’ Gojek customer. Correct?
Passenger.
Passenger. OK, before I start, I need you to pull down your mask and introduce yourself. I need you to say your full name and IC number.
Ong Soo Eng Daniel, 1721595G.
Alright can. ‘Uh’ I need you to speak a bit louder and ‘uh’ normal alright. Don’t speak too fast. OK, what language would, would you like you ‘uh’ to give your statement in?
English.
OK, you may request an Interpreter at any point of time on the statement for the language of your choice. Alright. This ‘uh’ interview is being video recorded to ensure that what you say is properly documented. It may be played back to the Court, Prosecutor and Defence Counsel. Do you have any issues to raise in front of the camera before we commence the interview?
OK, no, no.
Alright. OK, I understand that you’re, ‘uh’ previously interviewed by my colleague, IO Jerome yesterday. Alright. However, I have further clarification to make. ‘Uh’, do you have anything to say before I start?
Don’t know what to say.
Don’t know what to say. OK ‘uh’… the Police was informed that you had picked the passenger, the girl ‘ah’, at around 2am and only drop her off at around 4am. So, so which means the… the whole journey is about 2 hours. And she was inside your car. Can you tell me what happened during that 2 hours?
I bring, I bring her to a location and then…
…and then I try to wake her up. Then ‘uh’, that’s exactly what happen ‘uh’ what I have spoken to the… investigator.
OK.
But the journey I, I do not know because I don’t… I, I don’t see the timing.
OK, so you’re saying that ‘uh’…
…you brought her back to the location and you tried to wake her up and the rest was what was mentioned yesterday. And you cannot recall how long was the journey.
‘Uh’… from the time start and to the end when I reach, I, I ‘uh’ doesn’t, I didn’t monitor the timing. So I just follow the app direction so as what, so if I say that 2 to 4 I, I don’t know, I got no idea.
Alright, can. OK, I just want to confirm something. So, I understand that you ‘uh’… you pick up the girl and you drop her off at the location OK.
Based on the app ‘la’.
OK. Before you did,   something to her right? Did you move to a, a… a different spot where you stop?
‘Mm’ no, I believe I, I… I stop there.
‘Ya’. When I stop there I call her then I don’t pick up any  …
Until she alighted from the car?
‘Ya’, until she alighted from the car.
Alright. Can you remember exactly where you stop your car?
Cannot remember. As I say, I base on the app, the app, app say OK stop, so I just stop.
OK, can you, do you have any recollection whether you stop in front of her gate or, or is it the side of the building?
No, no is, is along, along the back, along the back road. I can still continue to move on but because I ‘uh’ stop, because the app say so. They pinpoint this location so I just stop there. So unless she wake up and then she tell me to go further, then I, I will follow ‘la’. Unless I follow on the app.
Are you good with the… road direction?
No ‘ah’, not good, not good.
Not good. So you…
…cannot tell whether you go straight, you enter Geylang Road or is it, or is it at the really the back lane where, if you go straight…
No…
…is all the way back lane.
I can, I can recognise is back lane because main road…
…is quite wide and then you can see the shop facing you OK. But this one is that, I, I don’t see the shop facing me, is like a back door facing me. Because all dark.
Alright.
So that’s, that’s what I can remember.
OK, sure. So, can you recall, I mean after you, after you did something to her.
‘Mm’.
After how long then she woke up?
5, 5, 10 minutes because after that I go back to my front seat, I look at, I start seeing the ‘uh’ YouTube, looking at the YouTube. I didn’t see the, the video on YouTube.
‘Uh’ so…
Then, I think when you watch you, you won’t see, you, you won’t know what’s the timing. So I would estimate probably 5, 10 minutes.
.
It cannot be 1 hour, 2 hours.
So, what you can recall is after you, you did something to her, you went to the front seat.
‘Mm’.
You watched YouTube.
‘Ya’.
And about 5 to 10 minutes, she woke up.
‘Ya’, around there.
By herself.
By herself.
She woke up by herself.
She woke up.
Is not because of you trying to wake her up?
‘Uh’ because I tried to wake her up, cannot. She doesn’t wake up.
So she own self wake up.
She own self wake up.
OK. OK, you have told the Police that ‘uh’ in your first interview, that the girl had paid you 18 dollars. Correct?
I… I couldn’t remember if, but I’m saying that roughly…
Right.
…around 18 dollar.
And however, the Police was inform that she had gave you 100 dollars…
‘Huh’?
…instead. OK. What do you have to say?
No, she didn’t give me 100 dollar.
OK, she gave you a 100 dollar note to be exact.
‘Oh’, I don’t have 100 dollar.
You never receive from any…
No.
…passenger before, a 100 dollar note.
No, never.
Then do you remember the denominations that you receive the 18 dollars?
Denomination ‘ah’. I cannot remember. ‘Eh’ ‘uh’ let me see, I remember I didn’t give her any change. So… is exactly 18 dollar. ‘Oh’ she claim that she give me 100 dollar.
Yes because you, you also waited for her about 2 hours, right.
‘Uh’ I waited for her for 2 hours?
OK…
I, I didn’t say that I waited for her…
OK…
When I, when I reach the location she’s already there wait, waiting for me ‘ah’.
‘Uh’ no…
She and her kind…
…I mean the, the…journey.
The journey ‘huh’.
‘Ah’…
‘Oh’ but journey cannot be, the whole journey cannot be 2 hour.
That is the estimation ‘la’. Because she was unable to wake up…
‘Ah’.
…then it took some time for her to wake up, so…
OK.
…so that’s the reason why she had paid you 100 dollars.
I see. And then… then why don’t she ask me for change? If she say…
She had no intention to get any change from you.
But how come?
… ‘ya’. ‘Ya’, that is just what she’s saying ‘la’.
She saying.
‘Ya’, so, so what do you have to say about that? Did, did you receive this 100 dollars?
No.
Or did you not receive?
I mean, even, ‘ya’ sometime ‘uh’ customer will give tip ‘ah’. They will never give so much ‘ah’.
OK.
And customer don’t carry 100 dollar  …
So OK, so just to confirm, you did not receive any 100 dollar note…
No.
…from her.
No.
OK.
Definitely no.
Just to confirm also, did you receive any 100 dollar note from any of your passenger before?
‘Uh’… OK, ‘uh’ long time ago, I do not know when. There’s a Chinese ‘uh’ passenger, give me 100 dollar note. I say I got no change. So ‘uh’ then she say how. So, the last resort is that ‘uh’ I give her my bank account and then she remit that part, I can’t remember now, many years ago.
OK, so…
That’s the only incident only.
So you did not receive any 100 dollar note before ‘la’.
‘Uh’ never.
Alright.
OK, in your first interview you had told the Police that you had pulled down her dress to see, to…
To take picture.
…to see her breast correct?
‘Ya’.
Did you pull her dress back up?
‘Uh’ of course after that I pull up ‘ah’. Can’t leave it like that.
So you did pull it up ‘ah’.
‘Ya’, ‘ya’ the last part we see her, she properly clothed.
Alright.
‘Ya’.
OK, at, what was the state of her dress when she woke up? I mean, you say you pull her…
‘Ya’.
…her dress back, so when… when she own self wake up right. Correct?
‘Mm’.
You were sitting at the front passenger seat.
I didn’t see her wake up but I, I hear noise by the time I hear that noise, she already sat, sat straight already. So I didn’t see her or wake up like that no, I didn’t. I was watching YouTube until ‘uh’ she ‘uh’ when I hear some noise, then I know that she’s, some movement already, so I turn around, she’s already sit straight behind me.
Alright sure. OK, ‘uh’… yesterday you went at, you went Seng Kang NPC to lodge a report right?
Yes, correct.
So, what made you decide to reveal to the Officer that you had taken a photo and you know ‘uh’… and…
…and video of the girl and what you did without her consent. I mean, what, what made you… you know.
‘Uh’ because when… the Inspector says that ‘uh’ there’s something illegal, not supposed to be there, I think the first thought is that ‘orh’ something illegal already. ‘Uh’ is the photo that I take.
So when the Officer say that there’s something illegal in your phone…
‘Ya’.
…the first thing that came to your mind was what, what you did to the girl ‘la’.
‘Uh’ ‘ya’. In, initially I was thinking that if this is just for my own view, if I keep it then it should be fine. Because I never expect that ‘uh’ to show it to anybody right that ‘uh’ this is just for myself. Since the Officer already know, then I just tell the truth ‘la’. What is, what is in the phone.
Alright. So other than inserting your finger into her vagina…
‘Mm’.
…right, did you insert anything else?
No.
No.
No. I, I, I will never rape a person. Yes, I will never do that.
Also, I need to ask you this, did you insert your penis into any part of the girl body?
No.
For example, vagina?
No.
Anus or mouth?
No, I, I never unzip my pants.
So did you do anything else on her? For example, you know like kissing, hugging…
‘Oh’ no.
No?
No.
So you did not… touch any part of her body other than…
‘Uh’ ‘ya’.
…her breast?
Her breast, no. I just pull down and then just take photo.
Like licking…
No.
…kiss the breast.
No, no I don’t have.
Just for the purpose of taking a photograph?
Yes.
Never caress? I mean like you know touch?
‘Uh’ no, no, never. Because I was at the front seat. I mean if I want to do that I would have… go back seat right and then I can do anything. But I did not.
OK, so the video was taken from you?
At the front seat.
Front seat?
In the front seat.
OK, so you did not went to the back of the seat ‘la’.
‘Uh’ no. Only the last part I went.
Last part, again sorry? Can you describe?
When the last part, that means when I pull down her shorts.
The one that you took the video?
‘Ah’ ‘ya’.
That one you were at the back ‘ah’.
‘Ya’, that one is at the back.
Did the door close?
No, the door open. I mean cannot door close what because I’m standing outside. I wasn’t inside. Because her, her, her leg already close to the door what.
OK. So, when, when you recorded the video you were standing outside…
‘Mm’.
…the car.
Standing outside.
So at no, at no time you sat beside her or…
There’s no place for me to sit ‘ah’.
…or both of your feet inside the car? No ‘la’?
No.
All the time both ‘uh’ I mean…
…did one of your leg enter the car during…
I cannot remember if one of my leg…
‘Mm’.
…could be not.
OK but  …
All I know is that, I go I, I was right behind and then that’s when I came in.
So for sure that one of your leg was outside ‘la’. Was outside the car ‘la’.
That, that one not quite sure but I know that I’m standing outside but you’re asking me that whether if one of my leg is in the car, I cannot remember.
You cannot recall ‘la’ but…
‘Ya’.
…OK, can. So did you save that video or photos in any other device?
No.
Or upload…
Just directly on my phone.
…in any online platform?
No, because I… I don’t go home so I put in my, my phone so that as and when if I needed, I just view.
Did you, have you done this to anyone before?
No. That’s why I say, I started 2019 until now. So I have never except for this case.
OK, I… don’t have an… I don’t have anything else.
But why did she… I’m curious that if she can, I mean usually ‘uh’ passenger say ‘uh’ OK ‘uh’, ‘uh’ usually if they give me 50 dollar and all, so I return you, I tell them how much first.
OK.
I, I…
OK, it’s… according to her that she gave you 100 dollars is because you waited for her. Alright. You waited for her to wake up because she know that she unable to wake up when she arrive at her place, correct. So… because of you waited for her…
‘Mm’.
…you know ‘uh’… she also understand that you’re a… driver…
‘Mm’. But I don’t think so…
…so time, time has been taken from you.
‘Ya’…
Correct.
…but I don’t think…
So and that’s the reason why she gave you a 100 dollar note and did not expect…
…a change in return.
I disagree on that ‘ah’. I will never take tips which is so… I mean 18 and 100 dollar is vast different. I mean why do you give me so much.
‘Ya’ ‘la’ like she say…
Normally if you say that you give me 50 dollar then I say keep the change, ‘uh’ I never have this experience but I don’t know whether will I or maybe I may but if you say 100, to me is 100 is really too much.
But, like you say ‘la’, you cannot remember or there, there, there was no time that someone gave you a 100 dollar…
No.
…note.
I’m saying that I definitely I did not receive any…
OK.
…not, not that I do not know…
Sure.
…or I forget.
Don’t worry we, we will investigate alright?
‘Ya’, ‘ya’.
OK, I’ve got nothing else for you. Do you have anything else?
‘Uh’…I got?
Do you have any question for me or do you have anything to say? In relation of the case.
‘Orh’ OK. ‘Uh’… no ‘ah’.
OK. Then  … ‘uh’ end the interview at 1:39pm.
OK.
Good morning, Mr Ng Long Hock, right? So this is the second VRI, video recorded ‘uh’ interview that we’re doing today. Now, before we start the interview, ‘uh’ what is your preferred language?

‘Uh’ what do you mean by “middle of the bed”?
So there were 2 beds. There’s empty space in between the beds, so I was in the middle.
OK. So you were in the middle. ‘Uh’ what about the girl? Where is she?
?
She was in front of me. So I was in the middle. She was leaning on the ‘uh’ cabinet, on the wardrobe.
How was she leaning on the wardrobe?
?
Considered like squatting there, leaning against the, the wardrobe.
‘Uh’ which part of the body was leaning against the wardrobe?
?
Her back.

After chatting, I got closer to her.
OK. So, continue.
‘Mm’.
Then hugged her.
‘Mm’. Carry on.
She didn’t have much reaction, just normal.
‘Mm’.
‘Mm’.
So after hugging her, I used my hand to touch her there.
Wh…where is “there”?
?
Private part.
‘Mm’ OK. ‘Ya’. So after that?
‘lor’.
OK. After I touched, she never say anything. She just said “Don’t want, don’t want”.
OK, then what did you do after that?
?
‘lor’.
I still the same.
‘Uh’ “the same” meaning?
‘lor’.
Still touching her private part.
OK. To clarify, what do you mean by “touch her private part”?
Insert into her private part.
OK. What did you insert into her private part?
?
Hand.
OK. Then…
Sorry. Hand or finger?
?
Finger.
OK. So what happened after this?
Then I think she got up.
‘Mm’ ‘hm’. Carry on.
After she got up, I stopped for a while.
OK. What did you mean by “stop for a while”?
Like, the meaning like she like want or don’t want like that, so not very sure.
So when you say “Stop”, did you mean that your fingers are still inside the vagina or removed…
…
…yours fingers are removed from the vagina?
… ?
‘Mm’…
I stopped, should be outside already.
OK. Then what happened after this?
Then she wasn’t very sure, then I put in again.
OK. Why, what do you mean by “She wasn’t very sure”?
?
The feeling she gave me was that she say “Don’t want” but I don’t know whether she really don’t want or not.
Why will you say so?
?
If she really don’t want, she would leave the place ‘la’.
She wouldn’t stand at the spot and say want or don’t want.
So what happened after this?
Then I still put in, then after that she slapped me.
Did she say anything when you put in…
…put your fingers in again?
?
‘lor’.
She also said “Don’t want”.
‘Mm’. How did she say “Don’t want”?

normal
It’s just normally… like just say “Don’t want” normally.
‘Mm’.
Then after that she shouted.
OK. So carry on, what happened after this?
So after she shouted…
…I stopped.
Then I tell her “I don’t touch you”. Then she was leaning on the wall.
OK. So this place where she leaned on the wall, ‘uh’ which part of the room was it?
?
Should be near the window.
‘Mm’. Did you show us the place earlier?
?
Yes.
OK. So when she was leaning on the wall, ‘uh’ what were you doing?
?
When she was leaning against the wall, I was a distance away from her.
‘Mm’. ‘Uh’ where exactly were you?
?
At her roommate’s bed.
OK. ‘Uh’ what were you doing on the bed? For example, when… were you sitting, were you standing, were you squatting?
?
Sitting.
Did you show us the location when you were seated by the bed just now?
?
Yes.
OK. So after that what happened?
Then after that I told her to calm down and I was impulsive.
OK. Carry on.
So she was leaning against the wall and she didn’t move. She just looked at me.
OK.
So she was looking at me, so I gave her some time to calm down for about less than 5 minutes.
‘Mm’. OK.
Then she go back to her bed.
But I was still at the same spot.
“At the same spot” do you mean on the bed?
?
‘Ah’
OK.
Yes.
Carry on.
So she got back to her bed, then I asked her where’s the toilet.
‘Mm’.
She told me that the toilet is over here. There’s one here.
Then I told her I want to wash my hands.
OK.
She…
The toilet… sorry.
.
Then she told me there’s a shampoo there, it’s white in colour. Use that to wash your hands.
OK. Which toilet was it?
?
Her bedroom toilet.
OK. ‘Uh’ to clarify, do you mean that the toilet was inside the bedroom?
?
Yes.
Did you show us the location of the toilet just now?
?
Yes.
OK. So after visiting this place ‘uh’ just now earlier today, ‘uh’ where did we go to?
?
‘Uh’  ‘lor’.
Back to police station.
Did we go any place other than the… this block, this unit and the police station?
?
No.
Before I clarify some ‘uh’ questions from Mr Lee, do you have anything else to ask?
Maybe ‘uh’ for a quick summary, right, can we just request you to describe, OK, what we did, OK, when we went to the unit together?
To record statement from me and then to investigate what the wrong things that I did there.
OK. Maybe to, to ‘uh’…
Clarfiy.
…clarify. OK, maybe she… he can start to describe from the mo…
…moment that we enter the unit door until we leave the unit door, what, what happened?
What he see and what he said.
‘Mm’.
Who was there?
‘Uh’  ‘lor’.
You brought me downstairs.
Sorry, can we clarify what happened in the unit, not…
…‘uh’ what happened outside?
‘Ah’.
‘Orh’, ‘orh’
The inside.
You brought me to the scene of the crime.
OK. And?
‘Ah’.
You asked me where I was in the scene and where she was in the scene.
OK. And?
Asked me like where did we move around to and also the toilet.
OK. And anything else?
Nothing else already.
OK, just to clarify, can you confirm the Officer who was speaking with you?
‘Ah’ I know.
Mr Kok.
Sorry?
This one ‘ah’? OK. OK, yes. OK, and ‘uh’ did you answer the questions that ‘uh’ were posed to you at the scene on your own?
Yes.
OK.
Anything else? OK, ‘uh’… I’m OK for this, so I’ll just clarify. So I’ve some ‘uh’ questions to clarify ‘uh’ from your, from the statement that we recorded yesterday.
OK.
So you mentioned that ‘uh’ when you put your finger into her vagina, OK, she… after a while she said “No” and you removed your finger from her vagina. Is that correct?
‘Mm’…
Yes.
Did she consent for you to put your fingers into her vagina for this first time?
‘Mm’…
I don’t think so.
Why will you say so?
?
Because at that time we were talking about some relationship things.
‘Mm’ ‘hm’.
Then after I ask her about her relationship with her ex-boyfriends, what happen, how long, all that.
‘Mm’ ‘hm’.
Then she said that all my ex-boyfriends were scums.
She met a lot of scums.
So she said that actually it all depends on feelings. Then I ask her if I touch you, will you do anything or not?
Then she said it all depends on feeling.
Then I told her something like in relationship you cannot accept the guy too fast.
‘la’.
Because she get into relationship too fast, then I tell her don’t get in too fast ‘la’.
OK. So…
…
Sorry.
… ‘lor’.
Then I got closer to her.
So why is it that based on what she said, you think that she did not give you consent?
‘Mm’…
‘lor’.
?
‘la’.
With the feeling she gave me was like trying to seduce me like that.
Why will you say so?
?
‘lor’.
By looking at the expression.
‘Mm’. So it’s still… I’m still not very clear why is it that you think that she did not give you consent for this first time.
Sorry
I don’t understand.
‘Uh’ OK, maybe I, I can just clarify, OK? ‘Uh’ you told us that you think she didn’t consent to you inserting your finger into her vagina just now, right?
?
Yes.
OK. So then you told us that you think that she is seducing you.
Is that correct?
?
Yes.
OK. So if she did not give you… if you think that she did not give you consent, why will you think that she is seducing you?
?
It was looking at her situation at that time, it’s like giving us a chance like that.
OK. So what gave you the impression that she did not give consent to you inserting your finger into her vagina?
?
‘lor’.
Never say ‘lor’.
‘lor’.
Just like that, normal like that.
So let me get this right ‘uh’, tell me if it’s wrong.
‘ah’.
OK, so the reason why you had the impression that she did not consent, OK, is because she did not say explicitly?
?
‘Ya’, you can say that.
OK, so before I ask about the second time that he puts his fingers into her vagina, does he have anything to add or clarify for this first time?
?
‘Mm’
Actually that… at that time, if she didn’t bring me to her house, then this thing wouldn’t happen.
So for the second time that you insert your fingers into her vagina, what you said yesterday was that ‘uh’ after you removed your finger, you put it in again.
And that was after she had said “No” for the first time.
‘Mm’…
Should be the second time.
The first time she already said “Don’t want”.
But she didn’t resist a lot then.
When I put it at her private part, she never like resist a lot, she just say “Don’t want”.
Was this the first time or second time?
?
First time.
OK. So first time she said “Don’t want” and you removed your finger. Is that correct?
?
Yes.
OK. After that you put your fingers into her vagina again. Is that correct?
?
Yes.
For this second time, did she give you consent to, to put your fingers into her vagina?
No.
Why will you say so?
She never say anything.
‘lor’.
Then I just ‘uh’ continue on to do.
So based on the situation at that time, if she was really unwilling, after the first time I put inside, she would leave the place already.
It is impossible for a girl under the situation that she is not willing to stand there after…
…after she say “Don’t want, don’t want”.
A normal girl would leave immediately.
Why will you say normal girls would leave immediately?
?
One is… a normal person, if you’re with somebody whom you have no feelings for.
Were you speaking about this from experience?
?
‘Uh’
This is normal, like…
…normal person’s reaction.
‘Mm’ why will you say it’s a normal person’s reaction?
?
‘Uh’
So it’s like a normal person’s reaction. If you don’t have feelings for a girl and then she keeps coming to you, you also don’t want ‘la’.
When she said “No” for the first time, what did it mean to you?
?
To me, it’s like… it’s not like she totally doesn’t want it.
Because I’m not at the place, at the location when it happened, ‘uh’ you… can you tell… can you elaborate more on why you think this way?
?
As in why she… why he thinks that ‘uh’ she may want it or she may not want it.
?
‘ma’.
Because looking at the situation at that time, if she really don’t want, she would leave the place immediately. She wouldn’t give me a chance to touch her again.
Where will you expect her to leave to?
?
‘Uh’
She didn’t leave at that time.
‘ma’.
If she was unwilling for me to do something to her, she would leave the place already.
OK. When you said “Leave the place”, where do you mean? What do you refer to as “The place”?
?
‘Ah’ like leave the room.
She wouldn’t stand at the same place.
OK.
So am I right to say that her staying there was the only reason why you think that you can continue to do your second act of putting your finger into her vagina?
‘Mm’…
So I repeat the question again?
OK, sure.
‘Ya’, considered yes.
‘Uh’ I’m done with my interview. Do you have anything that you want to clarify or you want to add?
?
?
OK, so I want to know is that why is it that when I did that… those things to her on that day, why is it she made a police report later?
Well…‘Uh’ I, I guess what you mean to say why that delay between the, the reporting, is it? The incident?
?
‘ma’.
OK, because I want to know when she made the police report. So why is it that from the time that thing happened until she made the police report, why is there a delay?
…
If something happened, she would make the report on the same day.
‘Ya’, I don’t know whether she made the report on the same day or a few days later.
Sorry, so he’s asking us whether the report is made on the same day or, say, a few days later, is it?
?
…question?
‘ah’?
Yes.
‘Uh’ I don’t think at this point of time it’s convenient for us to reveal this fact yet ‘la’.
‘la’.
‘Ah’ OK.
OK, other than this, do you have any other questions for us?
?
No.
Any issues to raise before we conclude this interview?
?
‘Mm’…
No.
Any questions? OK, then we will conclude this interview at 11:22 hours.
OK, OK.
The date is 16 of June, 2022. Time now is ‘uh’ 10:17am ‘uh’ good morning Mr Brian.
Morning ASP Ryan.
Alright so ‘uh’ this is to inform you that ‘uh’ we are going to do a further interview with you.
Sure.
And that ‘uh’ this ‘uh’ interview will be ‘uh’ video ‘uh’ video documented to ensure that what you say is ‘uh’ properly recorded. Alright?
OK.
Now. So may I check with you what’s your ‘uh’ preferred language for this interview?
‘Uh’ English please.
OK. And are you feeling ‘uh’ well in your health for you to proceed with the interview?
‘Ya’.
Do you have any issues with the interview being video recorded?
‘Uh’ no issues.
Firstly, I just want to check with you, ‘uh’ for today, do you have anything else that you wish to add on to what you have already told the Police in your previous interview?
‘Uh’ nothing to add on ‘uh’. It’s just that I still regret whatever I’ve done.
‘Hm’.
‘Uh’ and it troubles me ‘la’. I very stressed about it, ‘ya’. I…I regret it ‘uh’ thoroughly.
OK  "" ... Alright, so I’m going ‘uh’ read some clarification with you.
OK.
Regarding ‘uh’  "" ... some of the information that you have told the Police ‘uh’ previously, alright.
OK, sure.
‘Mm’, your previous interview with the Police, you mentioned that your fingers came into direct contact with ‘uh’ Grace vagina, 2 times. Is this accurate?
‘Uh’ yes.
You…you also mentioned that for both times, your fingers rubbed her vagina in the circular motion…
‘Ya’.
…is this correct?
‘Uh’ yes.
Are you able to tell me how long you rubbed her vagina during the first instance?
‘Uh’ actually it’s 1 whole instance.
‘Mm’.
It’s 1…1 and ‘uh’ I think the, when I first ‘uh’ rubbed her vagina, I think was ‘uh’ ‘uhm’ felt like a minute ‘la’ or less than a minute, I’m not sure. But I think around there.
Do…do you happen to like take, take a look at the time when you were doing so?
‘Uh’ no, I didn’t look at the time, ‘uh’.
"" ... So during the second instance, are you able to tell me how long you were rubbing her vagina?
OK. The second instance means because I paused at the first instance and then I continue. That is the second, that’s ‘uh’ your second instance ‘la’, right?
‘Mm’.
‘Uh’ I think also about a minute  "" ... ‘ya’.
So these ‘uhm’ time estimations are all based on your own feeling ‘la’.
‘Ah’ what ‘uh’ yes, correct.
So at the first instance of ‘uh’ rubbing Grace’s vagina, ‘uh’ other than rubbing her vagina, do you perform any other actions?
‘Uh’ no, I didn’t perform any other thing. I mean while rubbing her vagi…
…na, I…I was aroused.
‘Mm’.
So I had an erection so only other action that I did was ‘uh’ adjust my  "" ... because it was uncomfortable right,  I mean I was  "" ... so I put my hand into my pants to adjust my penis. Just to, you know ‘uh’ so that it’s not so uncomfortable.
OK, this was using your other hand, right?
‘Uh’ no, so that was the pause ‘uh’ so I think that was the pause between the first instance and the second instance. ‘Uh’ and then after I adjusted ‘uh’ my penis in my pants, then I continue ‘uh’ using the same hand.
So just to clarify meaning that after the initial rubbing.
‘Mm’.
When you had to adjust your penis in your pants, right.
‘Ya’.
At least you have to with…withdraw your hand first.
Yes, correct. I withdraw my hand first.
And then after you finished your adjusting…
‘Ya’.
…you have to ‘uh’ reinsert your hand.
I mean I didn’t insert ‘uh’ I mean I went to  "" ... So after I adjusted…
‘Ya’.
…then I ‘uh’…
‘Oh’ OK, what I mean is you have to put your hand back ‘uhm’…
Into her pants?
…‘ya’ into her pants, right?
Yes.
So the first time ‘uh’ when you first put your hand into her pants, can you…can you describe to me how you did so?
How I did do?
‘Mm’.
‘Uh’ if I remember correctly is through the…the bottom opening of her pants. ‘Uh’ one of the…the leg openings.
Do you remember which side of her…her pants?
‘Uh’ I think should be the, I think it’s the left side because…
‘Mm’.
…in the position that we lying down ‘uh’ the left side.
Alright, so ‘uhm’ that means you put your hand right, through the bottom of the left side of her pants…
Yes.
…that means ‘uh’ reach also in…inside her underwear.
Yes.
So after you reached your hand into her underwear and that’s where your ha…your fingers came into contact with her vagina?
Correct.
And just to clarify, it’s the outside or interior of her vagina?
‘Uh’ on the outside of her vagina. So around the circumference  "" ...
"" ... Do you still remember the kind of pants that Grace was wearing on the incident?
‘Uh’ I think it was the one of those ‘uh’ running shorts or exercise pants, I…I think so.
Do you still remember her, whether the bottom is those like compression tights or it’s a like op…open airy kind?
"" ... I think it was the open airy kind.
And for these ‘uh’ pants that Grace was wearing, was there like ‘uh’ inner layer for these pants?
‘Orh’ that one, I’m…I’m not too sure.
So there was ‘uh’ short break between the 2 instances of ‘uh’ rubbing Grace vagina. Correct?
‘Ya’, that was the…the time where I went to adjust ‘uh’ my penis in my pants.
And during this…and just to clarify that means during these period of time, ‘uh’ you were not in contact with her vagina, correct?
‘Uh’ no, I was not in contact with her vagina because I was using the, the same hand to ‘uh’ adjust.
Can you tell me how long was this ‘uh’ interval or break?
Probably about 5 seconds or so.
May I confirm with you that both instances of you rubbing Grace vagina occurred only after you have laid Grace on the sofa?
‘Uh’ yes.
Do you happen to take note of what time it was when you have placed Grace on the sofa?
‘Uh’ I can’t really, I…I didn’t see the timing but from my estimate, it’s probably about 1:30 or 1:45 or so.
1:30 or 1:45 am?
‘Ya’, probably around that…that range, 1:30 to 1:45.
OK. So ‘uh’ just to confirm one more time, you didn’t ‘uh’ happened to like check the time on your watch or phone when you were carrying out the first instance of rubbing Grace vagina?
No, I didn’t.
Can. After you have already adjusted your penis and was rubbing again, do you happened to take note of the time at that?
‘Uh’ no, because it was just a quick like  "" ... is in one, in one instance so…
‘Hm’.
…it’s just that when I was there, it felt uncomfortable so I adjusted myself.
‘Ya’.
And then ‘uh’ so ‘ya’ I ‘tsk’.
After…after Grace was lying on the sofa already, aside from her vagina, did you also touched her breasts?
‘Uh’ no, didn’t. When I was carrying her, moving her ‘uh’ from the bar counter to the sofa, that’s when I had to…to ‘uh’ go across her chest to lift her up.
OK  "" ... That means ‘uh’ after Grace was already lying on the sofa, you didn’t ‘uh’ go and touch her breasts?
‘Uh’ no, I didn’t.
Specifically?
‘Ya’.
On that incident itself ‘uh’…
…in your mind, how far did you wanted to go with the touching of Grace?
‘Uh’ I actually I didn’t, I wasn’t even, I…I don’t know what came over me. I normally I would not do such a thing, so I never had that thought in my head.
‘Mm’.
‘Ya’. So when I was doing the act, then I realised what am I doing with  "" ... that’s, that’s why I stopped.
OK.
So, because I…I check with you right, other than rubbing her vagina, you didn’t like touched her breasts.
No, I didn’t touch.
So it was only just rubbing of her vagina…
‘Ya’.
…straightaway?
Correct.
‘Uh’ is there a reason why you…you chose that instead of other actions?
‘Uh’ I think at that point ‘uh’ when I put her on the sofa, and her thigh was exposed to me and she wearing those short shorts so when I saw the exposed part, then I think that’s something trigger ‘uh’ or I…I don’t know what came over me to ‘ya’. To reach out for the part ‘la’, that’s all ‘uh’.
That part meaning ‘uh’ which part?
Her…her genitals. Her vagina part.
‘Hm’.
So may I confirm, when you were rubbing her vagina, were you just intending to rub or do even more?
‘Uh’ no, just intending to rub.
Why not more than just rubbing?
‘Uh’ I, in my…in my head, it’s…it’s already wrong to do that. And I think just at that instance I’m not, really not sure what came over me. I just, maybe it was just wanted to touch it ‘uh’ ‘ya’. So but it was nothing more.
"" ...
So after you have totally stop already, that means ‘uh’ after the second instance of rubbing. Do you happened to notice what time it was?
‘Uh’ no, I…I wasn’t  "" ...
There was one point when Grace confronted you in your bedroom with…and your wife was also present.
‘Mm’.
Do you notice what time was this confrontation?
‘Uh’ no, because we don’t have a clock in our bedroom.
…so I, we didn’t know the time.
How much time would have passed between you leaving Grace at the sofa and this confrontation in the bedroom?
‘Uh’ I presume about half an hour. Because I went to clear the, clear the space, I wash the…the glasses and the dishes. So ‘uh’ I’m not sure how long I took, maybe about half an hour.
During the confrontation in the bedroom…
‘Mm’.
…was there one point when you and your wife went into the master bedroom toilet?
‘Ya’, because Grace already called the…called the Police. So ‘uh’ and both of us are in pyjamas so we went to change ‘uh’ change our…our pyjamas.
‘Mm’.
Can you tell me what happened in the master bedroom toilet?
‘Uh’ we just change out clothes and then ‘uh’ my wife asked me, asked me about the incident and say what is Grace accusing you of and then ‘uh’ asked me whether ‘uh’ I did anything ‘uh’ at the  "" ...
Do you remember the details of this conversation?
‘Uh’ not…not in detail. But it was very short because we just rushing to change and then she asked me, did you do anything, did you do anything? I was like, no ‘ah’ I didn’t do anything.
How…how short was the time inside?
Maybe like a minute.
‘Mm’.
‘Uh’ because it’s…it’s we just change and come out. Because Grace was there also. Grace was just outside the toilet.
‘Mm’.
When you…when you say your wife were asking you whether you did it, right. Meaning the  "" ...
No, she say did you do anything?
‘Oh’.
‘Uh’ what did you do? So I just say I didn’t do anything. At that point, I just say I didn’t do anything. I say I didn’t do anything, I just move her to the sofa.
The sofa.
‘Ya’.
Do you remember telling your wife while still inside the toilet…
‘Mm’, ‘hm’.
…that you may have touched Grace breast and groin area.
‘Uh’, no I just told her, I bring her to the sofa so when I carry her, I may have. I des…I didn’t really describe the process in detail. But I said, the only thing that  "" ... was when I moved her.
‘Mm’.
You know, my hand might have come in contact with, definitely will have come in contact with her body. So especially because I’m going from behind to lift her up, ‘ya’.
So how about ‘uh’ telling your wife that you may have touched Grace groin area when you were carrying her?
No, I didn’t…I don’t remember telling her that I touched ‘uh’ Grace groin area.
Based on our investigations, your wife informed that you told her that you may have touched Grace ‘uh’ breasts and groin when you carry her. What do you have to say about that?
Probably on the, in the process of moving her but not like rubbing her vagina or anything. I didn’t…I didn’t.
So that means ‘uh’ to clarify right, firstly, ‘uh’ do you remember that you mentioned to your wife that you may have touched her, Grace breast and ‘uh’ groin when you were carrying her.
In the process of moving her ‘uh’.
‘Uh’ do you remember saying this to your wife?
I remember the…the breast part like because I was trying to describe it to her. But the groin part, I can’t remember myself saying that. Probably if she asks me, maybe she asked me, di…di I touched her groin area, I could have said it…I may have come in contact when I was moving Grace, ‘ya’. But not, I didn’t…I definitely did not tell her that I  "" ... rubbing her vagina.
So maybe did… she did ask you whether you touched ‘uh’ Grace groin area?
Like under her pants and…
‘Ya’.
…touch? ‘Uh’ no, definitely I did not tell her that I touch Grace ‘uh’ groin area under her pants, ‘ya’. Probably when I was moving her, maybe when I was describing to her like what ‘uh’ or how I move Grace. ‘Uh’ then I thought to say that our hands ‘oh’ my hands could have come in contact in the process of moving her.
But you didn’t tell your wife that you were rubbing Grace vagina?
Af…after you came out of the toilet…
‘Mm’.
…‘uh’ do you still remember what do you see?
When I came out of the toilet?
‘Ya’.
‘Uh’ it was just Grace ‘uh’ nothing, were still…because it was the master bedroom toilet, we came out it was just the master bedroom. She was still there, there’s 3 of us then we just waited for the Police to arrive.
So meaning ‘uh’ Grace was still in the bedroom?
Yes, ‘ya’.
‘Uh’ do you…do you remember what she was doing?
‘Uh’ she was just sitting on the floor crying.
Sitting on the floor, crying…
Yes.
Anything else?
In the master bedroom…
‘Mm’.
…no ‘uh’. I mean, she…after she made the call, we just sat there and…and until we, until the Police arrive.
As in the 3 of you all?
Yes.
Remain inside the master bedroom all the way?
"" ... ‘Ya’, then we heard the…the door knocking and then the Police called her say ‘uh’ you can open the door ‘ya’.
‘Mm’, ‘hm’.
‘Ya’ then, then that’s where we came out. Because my son was  "" ... so we didn’t take it to the common area. We just confront it in the master bedroom.
OK. So Grace didn’t went out of the master bedroom to wait in the living area?
‘Uh’ no. I mean after that, then she went to the…when she, after we opened the door ‘uh’ then she was sitting in the living area. That’s when they separated us and she sat in the living area…
OK.
…or the dining area ‘la’.
Alright…OK I’ve no further questions, do you have anything else that you wish to add?
OK ‘uh’ nothing else to add. Just wanted to clarify ‘uh’ the 2 instances, when you mention 2 instances…
‘Mm’.
…‘uh’ so because, I mean to me it’s 1 instance as in because there was a pause so that’s why you break it down into…
‘Mm’.
…first, the first part and the second part, right?
‘Ya’.
‘Oh’ so the first instance and the second.
‘Ya’. Because ‘uh’ based on ‘uh’ what you have describe also, right.
‘Ya’.
‘Uh’ after you first ‘uh’ was initially rubbing…
‘Ya’.
…then you had to ‘uh’ withdraw your hand out and then you put your hand back in. So that’s why I describe it as 2 instances.
‘Orh’…‘orh’…
‘Mm’.
OK, OK, OK, OK. Alright. OK.
‘Mm’, anything else?
‘Uh’ ‘nope’, that’s all I can think of, ‘ya’  "" ...
OK.
That’s it.
So with that, ‘uh’…

OK. Anything happen during 2022?
2022 I did ask her again.
‘Mm hm’.
But she don’t want so I just immediately just stop.
OK.
OK in your first VRI ‘ah’, you mentioned that you are…In …
…your first interview, sorry. You mentioned that you, you knew about ‘uh’ your second brother Luqman ‘ah’?
‘Ya’.
Going into Jannah’s room.
‘Mm’.
OK ‘uh’ which year was this?
I can’t remember because…
Is it before you started or after you started?
That one also can’t remember.
You can’t remember.
‘Ya’. But I know its night time ‘la’.  .
Night time?
Night time, ‘ya’ when I was about to go to the toilet. ‘Uh’ I was, I was having ‘uh’ having stomach pain.
‘Mm hm’.
‘Ya’. Because I, I saw him ‘uh’ my second brother…
‘Mm hm’.
…he went through inside ‘uh’ …
…
…my sister ‘uh’ sister room ‘ah’.
‘Mm hm’.
So I was told ‘la’ what happen.
OK.
And I just let it be ‘la’. I know it’s a wrong thing to do because I, I know it must be something happen between my sister…my sister and my second brother. So ‘ya’, but I’m the one who decided not to open up myself to  . Saying that it’s wrong.
Do you recall how frequent you saw this?
I’m not sure.
More than one time? Or only one time?
I think more than one time ‘ah’.
More than one time.
Most of the time I keep quite ‘ah’. Because we seldom talking to each other.  …
Just now you mentioned that you know that it’s wrong to go inside Jannah’s room ‘uh’ can you explain why it is wrong to go into Jannah room?
‘Uh’ because my mother always says …
‘Mm’.
…my mother …
OK.
Can I say…?
.
Sure, sure, sure go ahead.
Go ahead first, ‘ya’.
.
Her mother always says that everyone has their own places. Boy’s room, girl’s room.
‘Mm hm’
So I cannot go into the girl’s room.
OK.
.
‘Ah’ that’s it.
You cannot go into the girl’s room or the boy’s shouldn’t go into the girl’s room?
‘Uh’ the boy’s shouldn’t go into the room.
OK. Is this also the same for the girl’s? That they cannot go to the boy’s room?
Yes. Unless we ask both …
‘Uh huh’.
…both ‘uh’ both ‘uh’ side ask permission then whether can we go in or not then we go in.
OK.
OK so, ‘uh’ I’ll just recap. So you say that you remember seeing ‘uh’ Luqman going into ‘uh’ the girl’s room, Jannah’s room in…at night. So you remember the first is because you went to toilet because you have stomach ache and then you saw Jannah going ‘uh’ you saw Luqman going into the girl’s room.
You do know that ‘uh’ it is wrong to not…to for  …to go inside the room. And then ‘uh’ but you chose to keep quiet about it.  It happen more than one time. You saw him going to the room happen ‘uh’ more than one time.
‘Ya’.
OK. So I ask you to explain why you say it’s wrong to go into her room. So you say that your mom ‘uh’ taught all of you that everyone have a…has your own places. So the boy’s shouldn’t go into the girl’s room and the same goes to the girl’s, they shouldn’t go to the boy’s room. And if any of you want to go into the other’s room, you need to ask permission,
Yes.
OK.
OK, let’s go towards what you did ‘ah’. So other than the kitchen toilet, were there any sexual acts ‘uh’ between you and Jannah that happen at any other parts of the house?
It did happen …
‘Mm’.
…on inside the bed room ‘la’. But it’s only, it’s only about few times ‘la’.
Whose bed room.
‘Uh’ my sister room.
Your sister’s room. ‘Uh’ for this occasions would it be …
‘Uh’ this occasion when it started it’s already change into toilet. Kitchen toilet.
Meaning? It already change into …
‘Uh’
Meaning?
…rule ….
‘Mm’.
… .  ‘eh’ about rules and regulations  …
‘Mm’.
…  kitchen toilet.
So I, I did ‘uh’ before my mother make this rule about her ‘uh’ about the rules I did it inside his room. So after ‘uh’ this rules and regulations I switch it into the toilet.
OK.
So correctly done, I say correctly ‘ah’, so before your mother make the rules because you say that occasion happen in Jannah room not a lot, few times. So that few times, was happen in the room first no toilet?
OK  ‘Spoken in Malay’
‘Ah’  toilet.
Yes, before the toilet.
OK. So only after the rules then change to the toilet?
So after the rules then change to the toilet?
Yes.
Yes.
OK.
Also in your first interview, you mentioned that ‘uh’ you share one room with your brother’s, all your sister share one  room right?
Yes, Ma’am.
Then the other remaining room is your parent’s room. Has this always been the same sleeping arrangement?
‘Uh’…
…
‘Mm’.
… (Spoken in Malay?
‘Mm’.
yes, .
‘Oh’ since in the past it was like this.
Yes, in the past ‘ah’.  living room so…
… …‘ah’.
OK. So when we the boy’s grow big right, some of us wants to sleep inside the ‘uh’ in the living room. So we take turns to sleep in the living room.
.
As fast as we grow bigger, the boy’s room is smaller. ‘Uh’ I mean ‘uh’  …
Squeeze ‘ah’.
…squeeze.
‘Mm’.
Crowded.
‘Uh’ was…how…
How long have you been staying in this house?
?
.
If I am not mistaken 21 years ‘uh’ same as my age.
OK. So was there any point of time where the girl’s will sleep in their parents, in their room.
?
‘Uh’  ‘ah’  last. ‘Ah’.
Only the youngest.
Her, her name is Maisarah.
‘Mm hm’.
There’s only, only her ‘la’. ‘Ya’ that she will sleep…
Will sleep with your mother.
…only sleep with, with her parents ‘ah’. Sometimes with, with ‘uh’ with the boys also ‘la’.
OK. OK.
‘Uh’ was there any point of time where you all have a …has someone else staying in the house, and they were occupying the girl’s room? Before the girl’s change to the current room.
‘Uh’ last  ‘uh’ …
‘Mm’.
… . ‘Ah’.
When…in past when my grandmother was still around…
‘Mm’.
…that room was supposed to be my grandmother’s.
OK can.
‘Ya’.  side  girl’s room.
After my grandmother has moved out to follow my father side…
‘Mm hm’.
…‘uh’ that room ‘uh’ becomes the girl’s room.
Do you remember ‘uh’ when this is? That you grandmother
…moved out?
It was long before when I still young ‘ah’.
When you’re still young ‘ah’?
‘Ya’.
You still young then the girls haven’t born yet what. How young were you?
Not really sure ‘ah’.
You can’t remember?
Not say young ‘la’ but around maybe around primary what like that. If I’m not wrong. ‘Ya’.
You primary school the…
…
…Jannah would have already born already ‘meh’? Jannah and you were nine, eight years apart you know.
It was very complicated to tell ‘ah’ because that time we, we don’t know  …
So as far as you can remember, the girl’s had always have their room? Since they were young.
Yes.
OK.
So that means to your summary is when your grandmother moved away the room become the girl’s room?
Yes.
OK.
And then for the girl’s right, ‘uh’ are they allow to lock their door if they want?
‘Ya’.
Can, they can? So any …did, did your parents ever say that they shouldn’t lock the door?
Most ‘uh’ .
‘Uh’ my mother always say the girl’s room, the door must be close and lock.
Sometimes, ‘uh’  lock .
Sometimes my siblings forgot to lock the door.
The siblings he refer to the girl’s ‘la’?
Yes.
Have you ever told your sister’s not to lock their room door?
‘Uh’  rule ‘ah’.
After my mother make this rules, I have ever told my sister or sister’s …
‘Mm hm’.
…‘uh’ to close and lock the door.
OK but have you ever told them not to lock the door?

So we were told that Jannah would be scolded if she lock the door. Is this true?
?
.
No.
Has it ever happen before that she lock her room and then something happen?

That one I don’t know.
OK. OK so, so the allegation ‘ah’ there’s one allegation that in 19…2019 in the middle of the night ‘ah’ you ask Jannah to come, come out….
…from your parents room and then you brought her to your room. In the boy’s room and then you remove her clothes, then touch her breast, you put your finger into her vagina. Did this thing happen before?

If  …I can, I can say …
‘Ah’.
‘Uh’ what was it, I couldn’t hear the last part?
‘Uh’ .
That’s all I can remember.
So what you can remember is that whatever you did to her is all awhile it’s been the same.
Yes.

I not sure because I can’t really remember.
So what she claim middle of the night, you cannot remember whether what she say is correct, but you remember …you also cannot remember whether it’s in the day or night?
‘Ya’.
But you remember brother is not around ‘la’?
Not around or can’t be sure?
I can’t be sure also.
You can’t be sure.
‘Ah’.
OK but you do know that there’s  one time that it happen …
Yes.
…in your room.
‘Ah’.
OK. That’s fair enough. OK.
OK so I just want to confirm ‘ah’ when you say it ever once happen in the room ‘ah’, although I understand in your earliest interview with us right, you say that it happened in the toilet, all the things right? I just want to be very sure when you say did it in the room, what you did in the room? What kind of acts you did in the room?
The same process whatever I did, kissing, licking, touching her breast, put inside her vagina everything included.
OK so kissing? I, I need you to explain, Kissing and some more what?
‘Uh’ kissing…
‘Mm hm’.
…then I open clothes.
Open clothes. OK. Then some more?
And then touch her breast.
Touch her breast. OK Anymore?
Lick her vagina.
OK.
I tried to finger her around the vagina.
Try to finger?
Finger around the vagina.
OK.
And try to put inside her vagina but couldn’t also. Using my hand. Then ….
‘Ah’, but you tried to finger her but did it go in?
No.
You try to finger her but it didn’t go in ‘ah’?
‘Ya’.
And try to put the penis but didn’t go in also?
Yes, it’s correct.
Can, OK.
‘Uh’ when sexual acts took place in Jannah’s room, the girls room, are the rest of your sister’s around?
‘Ya’.
They are around?
Yes. They were sleeping.
They were sleeping. And this would happen during day time or night time?
Sometimes day time sometimes night time. That one …
They never wake up?
Sorry?
Never ever woken up before?
?
Sorry? No?
No, no, no.
No is it? OK. So your sisters will be around, they will be sleeping and then ‘uh’, ‘uh’ sometimes they …this happen sometimes in the day time or sometime in the night.
Yes.
They never wake up at all ‘la’? OK.
OK.
And then have any of the sexual acts happen in your parent’s room before?
Parents room no.
OK.
Never ‘ah’?
‘Ya’.
OK Saifuddin …
Yes.
…other than Jannah did you also sexually assault your second sister Junah?
No, only Jannah.
Only Jannah?
Yes, Ma’am.
Maisarah?
No, Ma’am.
Can you help us to understand why only Jannah?
Jannah, .
Why I chose Jannah I do not know, I’m not sure …
‘ah’.
... I didn’t even think that that is my sister.
.
I did it without thinking.
‘ah’, that’s all ‘ah’.
That’s all.
? OK.
So I just confirm what you say. You said that you do not know why.
‘Ah’.
You are not sure, you never think that she was your sister. You did it without thinking.
Yes, Sir.
OK.
OK. OK ‘ah’?
‘Mm’.
Are you aware if any of your brothers have also sexually assaulted Jannah?
.
Jannah?
‘Uh’  most, most of the time  Jannah ‘la’.
I only know my second brother but most of the time I didn’t know what did he did ‘uh’ with Jannah.
When you says second brother, can you tell us the name?
‘Uh’ Luqman.
OK when you say you know, is this because you saw it or he told you? Or you suspect he did? This are very different.
‘Uh’ I suspect he did.
You suspect he did?
‘Ah’.
OK.
The moment when he I think want to go inside the toilet...
‘Mm’.
…and then when I say I was having stomach pain.
‘Mm’.
Then when I go out the lock was, the door was lock at night.
Close.
Close.
Not close.
‘Ah’.
The door is close.
To the door, so I was like thinking is my brother, second brother inside or not.
OK.
So without saying anything I just keep quiet, I just go inside my own room and I saw my second brother not inside my, the boy’s room. So I suspected that he’s in my sis, ‘uh’ sister room.
OK so, you said that time when you say that you have your stomach ache, you came out from the toilet then the girls room was closed ‘uh’ you went back to your room, your brother ‘uh’
…Luqman is not inside the room. So you suspect he’s inside the girl’s room.
Yes.
OK.
But you just now you did mentioned that ‘uh’ the room was lock. How do you know that the room was lock?
Because I try to open but couldn’t.
OK. So when you try to open is only when you go back to the room and saw he’s not there, then you and try to open? Or you try to open first before you go back to the room and you saw he’s not there.
Before, before I go out into the room when I was having stomach ache…
‘Mm’.
I saw the lock ‘uh’ I saw the door was open.
‘Oh’ OK.
‘Ya’. So usually my sister’s will always forget they should lock the door. So I just roughly close ‘uh’ just ‘uh’ .
Shut the door ‘la’?
Close the door.
Shut OK shut OK the meaning of shut, completely close or just a bit?
‘Ah’, .
OK, slightly a jar.
OK.
Then after that ‘uh’ I went inside the toilet then I just do whatever shit I do.
‘Uh huh’.
Then after that when I go out the door was totally lock. And then …
Tot…OK lock means latching ‘eh’.
.
.
So …
Latching is locked.
So  after I go towards the door, then I was like thinking, I thought I was, I put the door roughly close.
‘Mm hm’.
Then when I try to mingle around the…
‘Mm hm’.
…mingle around the door knob…
Door knob. ‘Mm’.
It’s locked. So I suspected it was my second brother.
OK but at that time you don’t know that your second brother was inside ‘la’?
‘Ah’. At first I don’t know ‘la’.
Only until you go back to the room?
Yes.
You saw he’s not there?
Yes.
…
…suspect your brother is inside ‘la’?
‘Ya’.
OK.
‘Oh’ OK, Ok so you actually didn’t see your brother go inside your sister’s room?
‘Ya’, first I didn’t see.
‘Oh’.
‘Ya’. When I, after when I go out inside the toilet, after I go out the toilet…
‘Ah’, OK.
…then I check my room first.
‘Uh huh’.
Whether my four brother have or not.
‘Uh huh’.
Then I suspected my second brother don’t have.
‘Ah’.
So I go inside, not say go inside ‘ah’, I just go outside the door, my sister room and check whether the door lock or not. ‘Ya’. But then it’s already lock. So I suspected my second brother ‘la’ inside.
So that means after you see you brother is not inside you go out again and check the door.
‘Mm’.
OK. So listen to the sequence ‘ah’ whether is it correct ‘ah’. ‘Uh’ you have stomach ache first, you came out of the room, you saw your door ‘uh’ your sister room door is open, that they forget so slightly close, to almost close but not close.
‘Ya’.
Then you go toilet.
Yes.
You finish your business you come out you saw the door was closed.
Totally close. And locked.
Totally close then you thinking why totally close but you try and it was locked.
Yes.
Then you go back in the room you saw your ‘uh’ your
…brother Luqman is not there.
‘Ya’.
So you go out again and check the door, and it’s locked. So you suspect he’s inside?
Yes.
Then but you don’t want to think so much about it then you just go into the room.
‘Ya’, I go back to the room and just sleep.
OK. So that is the sequence?
Yes.
Is that Correct?
Yes.
‘Uh’ can ‘eh’? You want me to translate it?
.
OK.
You understand ‘ah’? OK. So that means you never see him going into the room?
‘Ya’.
You only know that he’s inside the room?
Yes.
Then corr ‘uh’ I just want to understand, because you told my colleague …
‘Mm’.
Fang Chee that  you only know that he did something to her. What do you mean by you know that he did something. What is the something that you think?
Like some…‘Uh’  ‘eh’  …
What I did …
…towards Jannah .
‘Mm hm’.
.
I could feel …what I did to Jannah I could feel that my younger sibling also did the ‘uh’ same.
When you said your brother, you’re referring to Luqman only?
Luqman.
Luqman only?
Yes.
OK.
Because all this while I only saw my second brother. My third brother and my fourth brother was nothing.
OK. So this particular sequence that you mentioned just now, was a one time? Before this you told me you saw him going to her room before a few times. Is that accurate or not?
That one…
OK I don’t want to guess.
‘Ah’.
I don’t want you to guess.
‘Ah’.
OK, I know you have a suspension, we will come to that later. I want to know whether you have seen with your own eyes before. What you have seen before.
I’ve seen most of the time the door close.
OK.
So I suspected my second brother inside. Most of the time…
‘Ya’, that’s all I can say.
Have you ever seen him go into your sister’s room?
No.
…at least once? Or once.
‘Ah’ no, not so far no.
So all the time is you think he’s inside.
‘Ya’. Because I know the moment when he, when the moment the door is locked in my sister room, and I check …usually I will check my brother’s room first.
OK.
To see all the four brother’s is inside or not.
OK.
So see ‘uh’ whether Luqman inside, Fikri inside…
‘Uh huh’.
Firdaus inside.
OK.
So if none of them inside, mean something wrong. So some, when, when I think about it, if one person missing means must
…be something going inside my sister’s room.
You are referring to them as missing, ‘uhm’ is it because before you saw them missing they were at home. Could it be that …
…at home.
…they are out of the house?
They…when they go out of the house they usually tell me ‘la’. ‘Ya’.
OK. OK.
Most of the time I sleep in the living room.
‘Ah’.
Now a days I sleep in the living room.
OK.
So I know my brother, where are they going. Because most of the time number…my third brother, Fikri…
‘Uh huh’.
He  …all this.
OK.
So I just sleep outside ‘la’. For the time being.
OK. OK so, let’s clarify this once and for all, once and for all ‘ah’. So you never really saw you brother entering your…the girl’s room, OK. What happen was that ‘uh’ you saw that your ‘uh’ the girl’s room were locked. You checked that your brother’s your brother’s are not around, If either of the brother’s not around and then you suspect that they are in the girl’s room.
Yes.
This only happen to Luqman ‘uh’ also happen to Fikri and….
Firdaus.
Fir…Firdaus.
Fikri, Firdaus I not really sure…
You are not really sure.
…because mostly I…I more close to my second brother than my third brother and my fourth brother.
OK. OK.
OK, but do you ever see Fikri or Firdaus missing like how Luqman was missing in the room?
I saw Fikri missing…
‘Mm hm’.
But he didn’t go inside Jannah room. ‘Ya’.
…
Most of the time Fikri…OK, most of the time Fikri and Firdaus…they only go home late because of their work…
OK.
…or they go out with friends also.
OK, OK.
‘Ya’. My mother always…how to say, nagging about them. ‘Ah’.
So when they are missing, they are not…you don’t suspect they are in the room ‘la’?
‘Hm’.
Only Luqman…when missing, you suspect he is in the room?
‘Ya’.
Only him? Am I correct?
Yes. I just don’t know why, because I got the feeling me and him like some…like some…some .
Sixth sense ‘la’.
‘Ya’.
Sixth sense is that…Luqman is also doing the same thing as what you did ‘la’?
Yes.
OK… Have you ever told anyone… ‘uh’ I mean…have you ever told your brothers about what you did to Jannah?
No.
Never.
No.
Have they ever told you what they did to Jannah?
No.
Or any of them did to Jannah? No.
‘Ya’.
So there were never any discussions.
There were no discussion, no…most of the time we…me and my brothers were arguing about something else…about other problems…
OK.
…about scolding, about…work…
OK.
…about everything.
OK.
‘Ya’.
OK.
So nothing to talk about…between you, and your brother about what you all going to do to Jannah?
No.
Never at all?
It’s like never, ever.
So if you suspect that Luqman is also doing the same thing, do you know which one of you started first?
We…I also don’t know.
You also don’t know?
‘Ya’.
‘Hm’. Have you ever told your brothers not to enter the girls’ room?
Yes.
Reason?
After my mother made this ‘uh’ rule then I told my 4 brothers ‘la’…
‘Mm hm’.
…including myself…
‘Mm hm’.
…not to go inside my sister room. ‘Ya’.
When you say your brothers right, do you mean…
All…
…all 3 of them?
…the 3 of them.

After I gave her blowjob then I think I…I lie her down. ‘Ah’. So she…she was the same position, that B1 there.
OK.
Then the B1 is…I’m on top of her.
OK. ‘Uh’ when you ask her do the blowjob, is the direction where you’re looking at?

OK.
So, I think I want to confirm ‘ah’. That arrow just now is where you are facing right. Is she…that means that she is also facing you, correct? Because she’s doing the blowjob.
Yes.
So when you asked her to lie down, this would also be the place where sh…the 2 of you lie down, on the floor?
‘Ya’.
So you asked her lie down before you go on top of her? Correct?
Yes.
OK.
OK   …
OK.
OK Saifuddin, before we, you know…end, I just want to confirm again, 2 things. When you try to put your penis into your sister’s vagina, into Jannah’s vagina…
…had…had it entered before?
Meaning?
OK, .
I didn’t.
Never, ‘la’?
You didn’t, haven’t…
Never.
I try to go inside but cannot.
Cannot.
‘Ya’, because the hole was too small. That’s why ‘ah’.
OK. What about when you use your fingers?
Same thing.
OK.
Because it was too tight, so I…not say couldn’t go inside ‘la’, because I try to mingle around…go inside the hole but cannot.
Mingle around.
OK, you mean…
.
‘Ah’ meaning ‘ah’…
Don’t have to be shy, OK.
‘Ah’.
Just, try to explain as…the best as you can. Don’t try to be shy because we are ladies. ‘Ya’, I’m used to it, OK. ‘Ya’.
You used the word ‘rotation’.
‘Ah’.
‘Rotation’ is rotation.
‘Ah’ ro…ro…OK. .
OK.
OK.
Then .
So I used my finger to play at her vagina.
‘Mm hm’.
Try to go in but cannot go in.
So never once succeeded in entering before?
No.
Not even abit…
OK. This is a finger ‘eh’?
‘Ah’.
OK, again. I repeat, ‘eh’. Have your finger entered?
No, finger, no.
OK, and then the Officer asked, tip…tip, meaning the tip, did it enter?
.
About the tip part…
‘Ah’.
…not sure.
Tip, as in fingertip ‘ah’?
‘Ya’.
Usually how many fingers you use?
Just only 1. Just my middle finger.
Next one?
Then the penis itself…because you say penis, then the finger...never put inside.
‘Mm hm’.
OK, so if let’s say if you are talk about the penis, how did you…that means you try to put, right? So how much did you try to put into the vagina?
Just only just a bit, but I cannot go in, that’s why.
But you say a bit, then tip…
Tip a bit…my tip of my penis…

OK, why do you do that?
Just for fun.
Just for fun. Just now you mentioned you was doing some editing on that time ‘ah’?
Last time I did do photography editing.
Photography editing. OK. So when did, when did you make all these pictures? That where you put your wife’s photo, or wife’s face on all these porn images?
2 years ago.
2 years ago. OK. I… Are you like fantasizing your wife in doing all those porn poses? Why do you want to put her face on these women inside the porn images?
‘Mm’ just… when I get the picture, porn is just, is suitable for the…my wife  …
OK. You get the porn images you said from Google, is it?
Yes.
OK what do you mean by suitable? As in you said when you…
…picture her face  …
You mean the direction ‘ah’? OK then so you, just now you said when you get images suitable for your wife then you will do this editing.
Yes.
But in the first place why do you want to do this editing? You want, as in like you are, do you have a fantasy of your wife in this position or what?
…
Then why you don’t put your own face like or why you want to put her face? You know what I mean right, there’s a lot of people’s face that you can put why you want to put your wife’s face?
Don’t know, just for masturbate, just.
OK so you edit these pictures to masturbate to the picture.
Yes.
Why you don’t just masturbate to the porn, the original porn photo?
I just still prefer my wife.
OK so you prefer your wife’s face ‘la’.
Yes.
OK.
Some of these sexual positions ‘ah’, is actually quite… quite, it look like quite difficult to do ‘la’. But do you have any fantasy for these kind of position or what? Like Annex B4? You ever try to do something like that with your wife? So is really just fantasy.
Yes.
In your head only.
… Just go through the porn then just see the picture like that.
OK.
Just…just drag.
But you go to a lot of effort ‘leh’ just to edit her face in. I mean normally people won’t actually spend that much time ‘la’, I mean you did a lot where is like not just 1 or 2 photo you know. Like you make the effort to actually Google, find the photo, cut the face, fit the face on the, the picture.
…
Sorry?
It never take long.
Never take long. OK. So you feel bad if you masturbate to ev… other woman’s face, is it?
I feel bad after I masturbate looking at the pictures.
So means what?
After masturbating is always like that.
OK this is what you feel guilty ‘ah’?
Yes.
So does having your wife’s face make you feel better or what?
‘Ya’.
OK.
Why does having your face, I mean why does masturbating to your face, to your wife’s face on the porn image make you feel better? As in do you mean that you feel like you are not cheating on her or?
…
‘Orh’.
So you feel like you never cheat on your wife you are still with her ‘la’.
Yes.
All these images that you put your face, your wife’s face on the porn images ‘ah’ did you ever send to anyone else or put on internet?
No never.
Did you ever cheat on your wife? That mean like after you got married to her do you ever, go and have sex with any other women? OK so the ‘makcik’ is really the only one ‘la’.
Yes.
‘Makcik’ you only do… the penile oral sex only right?
Yes.
Any other sex?
You married with your wife how many years?
Since I’m 26 now 52.
So 26 years old ‘ah’.
52 minus 26.
It’s 26 ‘lor’. OK.  So actually I’m, I’m quite curious ‘la’ you have been faithful for 26 years ‘ah’. How come you are attracted to a ‘makcik’?
…
And then why you want to do this kind of thing?
…
You just can’t?
I just get carried away.
Carried away.
…
You say you got carried away ‘ah’, but previous VRI I think you told me that you went to the ‘makcik’ house knowing that you are going to do something sexual with her right? Because you said that you felt that she was lonely right?
Yes.
So why did you even go to her house with the intention to do sexual act?
Get carried away, I think that period  …
‘Orh’.
Within that few days or few months.
‘Ah huh’.
…
OK,  …
Your answer OK, I ask you in your previous VRI you said that you went to the ‘makcik’ house with the intention to do sexual act with the ‘makcik’ because you thought ‘makcik’ was lonely. So I ask you why did you cheat on your wife, you said that because in those few months you kept going back to her, kept going back to ‘makcik’ ‘la’. Just now you said kept going back to what?
Means I get carried away get, I go back to her place, get carried away is not 1 day is after few months.
OK so your answer is in those few months I got carried away and kept going back to ‘makcik’ house.
Yes.
OK, can you explain what you mean by you got carried away? Like what do you mean?
Initially there’s no plan on having sex, just…
‘Mm’.
…first day I just met her  and there’s nothing.
‘Mm hm’.
Second day is just, I, I get confused is just second time meeting her and third time. I don’t know second time is the one I saw her at the, kitchen window or second time is I saw at the Loyang Point.
OK.
These 2 very confuse. So these 2 is also there’s nothing  …
OK wait ‘ah’. Explain what you mean by carried away. You don’t talk about you going round and round again what, what do you mean by carried away?
I tried to explain to you what I feel…
‘Ah’.
…there’s nothing actually in the first 3 meeting.
‘Uh huh’.
Only on the fourth meeting I have, the time that she invited me in…
‘Uh huh’.
…when I go back home, slowly start.  …
OK got carried away by what?
By she inviting me to her house middle of night and I was, I start thinking why I am maybe she is good maybe she’s…I start thinking how  …
You got carried away because she invite you in the house.
Means not carried away is…
…get the wrong thinking.
OK so your answer is I ask you what did you get carried away by, you said I got carried away, I got the wrong thinking because the ‘makcik’ invite me into the house.
Yes.
OK. You mean just because somebody invite you into the house, you immediately think of sexual thing ‘ah’?
No but if middle of night and she is loaded woman, start playing with your mind. What did she really wants then I go back home just start thinking  …
OK but you are, I mean you are someone who bother to go and…
I’m not blaming the ‘makcik’ or anything.
No, no, no let me finish. I’m saying that you are someone who make the effort ‘ah’, to go and edit… almost I don’t know wait ‘ah’. To edit 10 or 11 pictures of your, and put your wife’s face on the porn photo. I mean that’s how much you want to stay faithful to your wife even mastur… while even masturbating ‘la’. Then 1 random stranger ‘makcik’ invite you into the house in the middle of the night you straight away think about sexual thing ‘ah’? Like I thought, you are very big on being faithful to her your wife. How come 1 random ‘makcik’ asked you go to her house then…
…
You were tempted by a ‘makcik’ ‘ah’?
Not tempted, it’s just…
Then?
…I can’t explain this.
OK between the ‘makcik’ and your wife who is prettier?
My wife.
OK. Then can you explain why, if you don’t even think that the ‘makcik’ is prettier?
I don’t know how to explain to you I don’t know what came into my mind.  …
You want to do wrong thing?
What I did to the ‘makcik’ is wrong.
OK but can you help us understand why? Like… are you attracted to the ‘makcik’?
No.
OK if you are not attracted then why do you even want to do anything sexual with her? Is it because you think nobody will find out? Or is like very secretive in the middle of the night or is it very dangerous or exciting or what?
It’s just…
What, what, what is in your head?
I’m thinking of she’s, she’s the one who want it, she’s the one who initiate…
You mean…
…for me to come to her house and…
OK. So what about the fact that she initiate and invite you to the house?
…
She what?
.
‘Ya’ so you said that she is the one who initiate and invite you to the house but so? Why, why, what, what is about that thing that makes you want to do it? I mean I can be attracted to someone but if I remember like I have a wife I can go home. But what made you want to do? You say you not attracted to her right?
‘Ya’.
Then? Is it the idea of a affair is very exciting or what? Then why, then why do you want to step into the house at all? You can just wave bye and go back to your house what. Why do you want to go up?
That’s what I did.
‘Ya’ ‘ya’ ‘ya’ correct ‘la’ why ‘la’. Unless, are you telling me you are in a habit of going to strangers’ house whenever they wave at you?
No.
So any answer or explanation?
…
Or is it that it is very nice to have some woman wanting you and initiating a sexual thing, is that what you are saying or what? How did any Tom, Dick and Harry even, wave to you means you want to do sexual thing with her? Or is that really the thing for you?
Is not anyone that wave at me.
Then?
Is middle of the night, there is nobody at home and that create the scenario.
OK so you are saying that because you…
Giving, giving me the thoughts of maybe wants to have sex.
OK but why would you agree? If you tell me she is not pretty, your wife prettier, you are not attracted to the ‘makcik’ then why would you agree? Even though you think she want it. Can’t be every woman that you meet you know they want it then you do what or is that, is that your thing, like anyone who wants it with you, you are OK to do?
I just…  …
Is it because you think she won’t tell anyone? And there’s no one in the house to see?
…
You just told me that you, the fact that she has no one at her home gave you the thoughts right, of sex.
‘Ya’ but she is alone there.
OK so you said that you are not attracted to the ‘makcik’, you know you do wrong to ‘makcik’, but ‘makcik’ initiate and invite you to her house, you saw that ‘makcik’ was alone at alone and no one else was alone at home with her.
Yes.
OK. So why do you think that, just because she invite you in the house why do you interpret it as invitation for sex?
Is not, in, immediately is just when I go into her house and initiate, let her watch the porn and she get excited. That’s why  …
OK so I ask you just because ‘makcik’ invited you into her house, why did you think she was inviting you for sex, or sexual act ‘la’. You said not at first.
Yes.
You went into her house and show her porn on your handphone.
Yes.
She got excited then I thought she was lonely and wanted to do sexual act.
Yes.
You said not at first because you enter the house, what did you all do? You all only make small talk only right?
Yes.
But the thing is you are the one who show her porn on your handphone.
Yes.
Did she ask you to show her porn?
No.
Then like that you are initiating it what. Where, where got her? She talk to you, talk about any small talk thing, unrelated to porn right? She make small talk about what?
…
…
Where are you going and?
Have I eaten or not.
OK.
Ask me if I want to do it. She make some touching when she talk to me she put my hands here.
You say what she touch your arms.
Yes.
And? She said what?
When she was asking me whether I want some drink or…
She want some what?
I want some drinks.
Anything else? She touch your arm where?
Shoulder here, to hand.
Left shoulder ‘ah’ is that, is that the shoulder? Which one is your left side?
Right side.
So she touch your right.
…
So she touch your right…
Right hand, shoulder.
…shoulder and arm. Your upper arm ‘la’.
Yes.
OK. Right shoulder and my right upper arm. And she ask you if you want drinks.
Yes.
Did you want drinks?
No.
OK. So after you say no to the drinks, you straight away take out your handphone and show her porn ‘ah’?
‘Ya’ we sit down a bit.
Sorry?
We sit at the table then we start chatting after that I just take out my phone.
This one you are describing ‘ah’, this, touch the arm all these, is it the 3 January 2023 incident?
No the previous one.
Which month?
November.
OK. November 2022 is it? So before you showed her porn on your handphone, did you all even talk about anything sexual?
No.
Then if you all never talk about anything sexual what give you the idea to suddenly show porn video to a stranger female, that you meet only a few times, and you don’t even know her name right? ‘Ya’ so why do you want to show porn video to a woman, that is not your wife and you don’t know her name. Why you want to show her a porn video?
…
And she never ask for the porn right? OK so why? What is the purpose of showing her a porn video?
To see her reaction.
What is your own reaction when you watch porn video on your own?
Excited.
So you told me that you when you watch porn video on your own you get excited.
Yes.
So by showing ‘makcik’ a porn video, are you trying to see whether she can get excited?
You mentioned you want to see her reaction right?
Yes.
So are you trying to see whether she will get excited?
Yes.
OK. Why do you want to get here excited?
Cause I already thought that she’s lonely and she’s I just want to comfort her.
You want to confirm what?
That she’s, she’s lonely.
But don’t you think that if she never anything sexual to you, by showing her the video, you are putting the idea of doing something sexual into her head what. You know what I’m saying?
‘Ya’.
So…
It’s just…
Do you agree?
It’s just that…
Wait ‘ah’, because if I meet you for the first time or I, I only meet you a few times I only know your name, I don’t know that much about you, we never talk about anything sexual, you suddenly show me a porn video, so, aren’t you putting the idea of a sexual thing in my head if you show me the video? You know under… what I’m saying? ‘Ya’.
What I am trying to explain is, when she invite me to her house in middle of night then…
You wait ‘ah’. Don’t talk about the, I was just, I, I’m just asking you about the video first OK?
So now I ask you again, by showing ‘makcik’ the porn video ‘ah’ without her asking ‘ah’, do you think that you are actually putting the thoughts of the sexual act in her head?
This why I’m trying to explain to you why I put the I show her the video.
‘Mm hm’.
Is… is she is the one who already put something in my head that made me want to show her the video to confirm.
‘Ya’ ‘la’ but what did she do that put the idea in your head?
By inviting me to her house in the middle of the night. And what do you mean that ‘oh’ you would do that she is not wrong.
Have you considered that she might not be normal?
…
Because this is not normal right? That is what you are telling me right? Normal person wouldn’t ask a man or normal woman wouldn’t ask a man to come into her house at night right? So you ever considered that she might not be normal or not?
…
OK anyway because after you come into the house she didn’t even mention anything sexual right? Until you go and show the video without her even asking.
Yes.
So you want to, you said that you want to confirm if she is horny.
Yes.
You want to see whether she can get excited.
Yes. It’s not getting her excited.
That’s what you said earlier.
‘Ya’ so.
You said when you watch a porn video on your own you get excited.
…
So when you show her a porn video, you want to see her reaction if she can also get excited.
Not excited is she would react to it.
‘Ya’ ‘la’ what kind of reaction you want?
How she react see if   … if she like to watch.
OK so I asked you have you considered the ‘makcik’ is not normal to invite a man into her house at night. OK wait, have you ever considered that ‘makcik’ is mentally not normal to invite a man into her house at night?
No.
OK. So you don’t think that she’s abnormal ‘la’ you think that she is horny.
Yes.
So in your previous VRI ‘ah’ you said that she needed assistance to find her block. But you still don’t think she’s abnormal ‘ah’?
No.
Why ‘ah’?
…
You think that normal people will need help to find their own house block ‘ah’?
Which is the 1 time she, she was with my wife that’s all.
Can but, you think that a, a normal person will also 1 time cannot find your own house block?
Maybe.
Have you personally experienced that? Or know anyone that does that?
My father.
Your father how old?
74.
‘Orh’ 74. So you think that at 74 that is normal not to know their way back ‘la’.
Because he sometime just go to the shop and say which way to go back home?  …
OK.
But when he find the route that he is familiar with he can go back home.
You say your father go where?
When we go shopping all he just come out from another exit.
So your, you say that your father sometime go shopping but cannot find the way back.
Not cannot find the way back.
Then?
On his own he just which way go back  …
‘Ya’ ‘la’ so which way to go back which way to go back means doesn’t know the way back ‘la’. If not what is he asking?
When, when he was at that location he’s not familiar with.
OK so you are saying that, your father sometime go shopping but doesn’t know the way back.
Yes.
Yes ‘ah’.
Yes.
Your father is 74 right.
Yes.
Do you, in this case would you consider your father senile?
No.
So don’t know the way back is not senile?
No he can remember a lot of thing  …
OK anyway…
… spurs of moments  …
OK anyway your father is elderly ‘la’, do you know of any normal adults below the age of 50 that doesn’t know their own way home?
No.
So normal adults usually know their way home right?
Yes.
So is only when they are elderly and above the age of 50 or 60 then there’s…
…a higher chance of them not knowing their way back right? Or you think that young people also have this problem?
Not all the older generation having that problem.
‘Ya’ I said higher chance, I never say all. So do you agree that elderly folk above the age of 50 or 60 have higher chance of forgetting how to go back?
Yes.
OK the other thing I want to ask you ‘ah’ just because you think that ‘makcik’ is horny ‘ah’, then you want to do sexual act with her ‘ah’? I mean just because she is horny and lonely you want to do with her? What is your answer?
…
Sorry?
I got carried away.
Because you mentioned that you are not attracted to her, she is not pretty.
Yes.
But just because she is horny and she is lonely and she got reaction to your porn video, you are OK to do a sexual act with her ‘ah’.
I got carried away   … is just…
You not OK with it means what? You are not OK with it after the act right, after you go home right?
During the act means I, I did…
Then why did you even go to her house?
I, I feel guilty means I feel guilty I stop it and I go back home. Doesn’t last that long. Only like 10 minutes.
We watched the CCTV footage ‘ah’. You made her suck your penis repeated times you know. Everytime she push the penis away from her mouth you will put it back and put it back and put it back at least 3, 4, 5 times and we counted.
Without struggle.
‘Ah’ ‘huh’ you struggled to put your penis at her mouth ‘ah’?
She never struggle.
‘Ya’ but…
She was concentrating on the video.
So what do you mean you stop it? She’s the one who stop it what. She push your penis away what. You even take off her pants right?
Yes.
‘Ah’ you want to put your penis into her vagina right?
Yes.
So you stop it or she stop it? Cause she pull her pants up right?
Yes.
She don’t let you put right? Or did she let you put inside?
No, she don’t.
So did, she didn’t let you?
No.
So who stop it? You stop it or she stop it?
What I mean the first one. First time. First time coming to her house.
Never mind I’m talking about 3rd January. She stop it or you stop it?
She stop it.
OK so now you know she stop it ‘ah’. So after you…
…said the incident before 3rd January why did you even go back again on 3rd January? Means 3rd January not first time right? There’s another first time right? You said November 2022 right?
Yes.
So why did you even go back if you feel so bad?
So just now you told me that for the 3 January 2023 incident you didn’t stop it. It was ‘makcik’ who stop it, but you stop her from sucking your penis for the November 22…2022 incident, is it?
Yes.
OK can I ask you again like why do you feel the need to do a sexual act with her just because she is horny and lonely? Like, like why do you care whether she is horny or lonely or not? Not, not your, she not even your friend right? Like so why do you care, what stage she is in? Like she can be lonely or alone in the whole house, why you want to go in and… do with her? I mean is it your business that she is horny? She’s not your wife right?
No.
Then why do you care that she’s horny?
You got any answer?
…
Sorry?
…
Can you. can’t hear you.
I don’t know what to say for that.
OK ‘ah’ I repeat ‘ah’ my question was ‘makcik’ is not your wife, why do you care that she is horny or lonely? Why is it your business? Why do you have to do sexual act with her? You said, your answer is I don’t know what to say.
Yes.
Anything else you want to add? Anything else? If not I go to the next question.
Is my mistake.
Is your mistake.
A stupid mistake  …
I mean like… OK anything else? I go to the next question ‘ah’. In your previous VRI you mentioned that you admitted to your penis being inserted into the ‘makcik’ mouth, in between the ‘makcik’ lips and teeth because the police said that the ‘makcik’ went to, went to wash her mouth. After the blowjob. After sucking your penis. So were you worried? That your DNA may be found inside her mouth?
Yes.  …
OK. Why were you worried that your DNA may be found inside her mouth when you are saying that your penis didn’t go inside her mouth? You worry for what ‘ah’?
On the spur of moment, it’s just like…
‘Eh’ what?
Spur of moment when the policeman was asking me, it was like…
No, no my question is, the police said she went to wash her mouth. But if inside your heart, if you really think that your penis never go into her mouth inside ‘ah’, then why you worry that your DNA will be found inside her mouth?
Is not worry is just when I talk to the policeman I say…
But just now you told me you were worried, you said yes.
…no I try to explain to you now. Is not worry actually is when the policeman ask me I say they got the DNA, they say I said maybe it into her mouth and her lips and her teeth. And then they put there I went into her mouth and pee. I just say maybe it, it just go into the mouth and take. Cause she is rubbing it on her lips. Maybe she parted her lips when put, it touched the teeth. That’s where they get the DNA. The policeman ask me that. Can you explain to me how you get the DNA? And I say maybe is like that.
OK but at that moment, there’s no DNA report yet you know, why, why would you be worried that your DNA is found inside her mouth?
The first thing the policeman come to me and say, OK we got the video we got the DNA already, you better tell the truth. That’s what they say.
Are you saying that he’s saying that your DNA might be found inside?
Yes.
You didn’t see any report ‘la’.

…everything ‘la’. So I read to you ‘uh’… the Criminal Procedure Code 2010, Section 123 to 125. So you, Muhammad Shahnizar Bin Rozlan, male 30 years old. Is that your age?
Yes, correct.
NRIC S9121836D, date of birth is 20th June 1991, Singapore citizen, are charged that you on the 26 April 2022, at about 7pm at the level 15 lift lobby, block 969 Hougang Street 91, Singapore did sexually penetrate with your finger, the vagina of one Nur Arila Fazirah Bin Binte Muhammad Jufri, female date of birth is 26 May 2009, a person under 14 years of age, without her consent. And being in a relationship that is exploitative of the said Nur Arila Fazi Fazirah Bin Muhammad Juf, Jufri.
And you have thereby committed an offence under Section 376 punishable under Section 376 in the Penal Code 1871. So I read to you the punishment ‘ah’. Section 376 of the Penal Code states any person aim to sexually penetrate the part of A’s body, other than the penis with a man or anything else, the vagina or the anus, so in this case is the vagina. As, as the   may be of another person, shall be guilty of an offence if B did not consent to the penetration.
Or if B is below the age of 14 years old, whether B did or did not consent to the penetration. You understand so far? Understand ‘ah’. So the punishable under 376 of the Penal Code states whoever commit this offence under Sub-section 2, against a person below 14 years of age, with whom the offender is in a relationship that is exploitative of that person. So ‘uh’ the relationship is exploitative because you are the step-father ‘la’.

If you keep quiet now of any fact or matter in your defence, when you reveal this fact or matter in your defence only at your trial, the Judge may be less likely to believe you ‘la’. So this may have a bad effect on your case in Court. So therefore, it is better for you to mention any ‘uh’ fact or matter now.

‘Orh’…  …I do not have. We…
Or is it changing daily?
Fixed one. …change… .

It’s fixed. Cannot change one.
‘Ah’.
OK. But the…you’re, you’re not sure at the point of…at this point time, you’re not sure what you were doing at that….back in 2014, the first 3 quarters whether which one has more tendency, is it?

‘Orh’. .
I forget already.
Can. No problem.
Can.
OK. I’m just going to tell you the allegations that we have right now. OK. Basically, OK, we have information, OK, on 21st of February 2014, OK…
…sometime in the afternoon, OK, actually in fact, early morning…
… ‘uh’ maybe around 10 plus, OK…
…you were at Block 650, Pasir Ris, OK, and…
…you…
…performed an act of sexual assault by penetration…
…on a little girl. During which the photo I showed you on Annex A.
What do you have to say about this allegation?
‘Huh’?

Have you ever came across this person?

‘Ah’.
And what’s so special about DNA, do you know?
…DNA… ?
…
…  ‘la’.
Can test the person’s genes.
OK. So, what is so special about DNA…
…is that DNA is very unique. OK, the chance or the odds of 2 person having the same DNA, unless they’re cloned, OK, is virtually ‘uh’…does…virtually doesn’t exist. OK. Or at least there has never been shown to have exist ‘uh’ at this point of time yet.
…DNA… …DNA… .

Don’t have.
How do you then explain that your semen is found on this girls clothing?
…
‘Huh’?

I don’t have a way to explain also.
OK. Sorry ‘uh’, I just want to confirm your position at this point of time. You’re denying that you ever done anything to any of the girls. ‘Uh’…in terms of sexual assault-wise?
‘Hm’?

‘la’.
No…not related.
‘ah’.
Only when I’m very urgent then I will just go and find a place and just urinate.
‘Mm’, ‘uh’, OK. That one ‘huh’ is because we are asking you whether you did anything sexual to any little girls and you said you only pee.

‘Ah’.
‘Hm’? …case… .
Because the recent case was this thing.
You’re talking about the one at Bedok is it?
‘Ah’.
OK. OK, can. That aside, nothing else that you’ve done to little girls in terms of sexual assault? It could be something as simple as exposing your penis. Or something as serious as penetrat-…
… -ting your penis into somewhere…on the body of a little girl that should, should not be done.
‘Mm’.
Or as inappropriate.
OK. ?
‘Ah’.

On 20th June 2022 I went for a staycation with 8 of my friends. I think the hotel name is Harbour Ville, Ville, Ville …Harbour View Hamilton. There were 2 hotel rooms. During the staycation we mostly hangout in 1 room. However on 21st June 2022 at about 4:00 am one of my friend Jeremiah told me that he need to sleep.

Jeremiah was on my left while Cazaiya was on my right. On 21st June 2022 at about 07:45 am Jeremiah left the hotel for work. After that it was just Cazaiya and me in the room.
After Jeremiah left the hotel room, I suddenly had the urge to engage in sexual intimacy with Cazaiya. I started to rub Cazaiya’s vagina over her shorts before I slipped my hand into…
…in the next page…
…into her panty to rub Cazaiya’s vagina skin on skin. Thereafter I inserted my right middle finger into Cazaiya’s vagina. Cazaiya was asleep at that time. And I heard some moaning noise coming from her. After that I removed Cazaiya’s shorts and panty before removing my own shorts…
…and underwear. I went to a missionary position as I wanted to have sex with her. However, I did not insert my penis into her vagina. I was in…I was in a position with my penis exposed for a while before Cazaiya woke up. Cazaiya saw me and said “What the fuck”. She asked me for an explanation. However, I just kept quiet. Thereafter Cazaiya left the room. I left the hotel room…I left the hotel at about 9 plus in the morning on 21st June 2022 as I was embarrassed. Statement recorded at 12:50 pm.

So
So we looked at both of us photos.
So this is before the second incident?
Before the first incident happened.
While we were scrolling Facebook.
So this is not the 5 minute break you are talking about?
No.
So before the fingering, she already told you she wants to go back?
Before the first incident.

So when is…when was it that she say that she wants to go back?
Before the second incident.
So before the second incident, she said that she wants to go back?

Then
Then the second incident happened.
Why do you think she wants to have the second round of fingering when she wants to go back?
OK
She seem to say OK because ‘uh’…
…I said another 5 minutes then she seemed to say OK.
Then we proceeded for the second session.
OK ‘uh’ you says that ‘uh’ Faa was OK with all the sexual…with both sexual acts.
OK
Then why do you say … why do you think that she call for Police? Claiming that you have sexually assaulted her.
OK my wife was the one who pressured her to make the Police report.
OK. Do you know what she told your wife?
I don’t know.
OK why do you think that your wife wants to pressure to lodge a Police report?
‘Uh’…
…when my wife came. So she asked her to confess.
OK my wife asked what we were doing.
So she…
…she insisted that Faa confessed ‘uh’ to what we had done.
Then
At first Faa didn’t want to admit.
Admit of what?
What we had done.
So you are telling me that your wife wants Faa to admit of your sexual affair with you?
Correct.
‘Uh’
So you are telling me that Faa is lying to the Police?
…
When she was saying that she was sexually assaulted.
‘Uh’
OK I got witness, my wife was the one who ‘uh’ want the report to be done.
OK my question is…
…OK regardless what your wife told Faa to do.
‘Mm’.
You are telling me that Faa had lied to the Police claiming that you have sexually assaulted…
Is that what you are trying to say?
OK. If that is the truth, then ‘uh’ she could actually ‘uh’ shout when ‘uhm’ ‘uh’ we did the first incident or leave me.
OK so, so to summarise OK to summarise ‘uh’ so that we are clear. The wife…your wife had saw you and the girl ‘uh’ doing the fingering.
OK
OK I’m not sure whether she has seen…
…but she was, I was… she saw me from behind.
OK. So she asked 2 of you to confess.
OK
Correct.
…
To confess about the relationship.
‘Uh’
‘Uh’
‘Uh’ what had happened.
OK. And according to you, what had happened was consensual.
OK ‘uhm’
‘Ah’.
Because I was drunk.
So I was following my desire.
So this happened.
OK. So can I confirm with you, was the fingering consensual?
OK
Correct.
OK so the…so you are saying that the fingering was consensual. And your…your wife saw the 2 of you together.
Correct.
‘Uh’ I was with her.
OK is it illegal for what the 2 of you were doing?
Yes.
I admit I did wrong.
What do you do wrong?
…
I disappointed my family.
I made her…embarrassed the, Faa’s family embarrassed.
OK but is it illegal?
Is it against the law?
I think if ‘uh’ it’s over the age ‘uh’ there’s no problem if consensual.
So the question is, is it against the law what you have done?
OK
Wrong.
What…what is wrong?
I disappointed both the family.
‘Uh’ not about disappointing.
OK
Is it against the law to…for the 2 of you to…for you to finger her?
OK
Wrong.
But what…what is the wrong?
Because you are saying it’s consensual.
I’m not, I…I’m not well versed about the law.
OK so, so you don’t know what you have done to the girl is against the law or not against the law.
Correct.
Then why did you still do it?
Because we were both ‘uh’ tempted after watching the video.
OK so can I confirm with you ‘uh’ that ‘uhm’ did you asked her for her permission before you finger her?
OK
Yes, I asked her permission to kiss her…
OK what about the fingering?
When asked her, can. Can or not.
Then what did she say?
She was shy.
Alright, did she say anything?
She didn’t say anything.
Then it happened.
OK.
OK? OK ‘uh’   …
I…I apologised to both side and her family.
Why you need to apologise to Faa?
Because she…this happened…
…because of me.
What did you do?
Because of me, she was attacked by my wife.
Then ‘uh’
How to say ‘uh’.
And she was   …
Because of the neighbours were there.
OK so sorry, just go back to clarify ‘uh’. So you just now you said that you are not sure whether what you had done is against the law.
Correct.
And you said that…but you also said that what you did was wrong.
What I mean wrong is because I had disappointed my family.
OK. So you…so you think that it is disappointing your family and it is not against the law.
So if it’s consensual, it’s not wrong.
OK, consensual then it’s not wrong. OK then but you are also saying that your wife pressure the Faa to lodge report.
Correct.
What’s there to report if it is nothing wrong?
OK
Because we are in the process of ‘uh’ divorce.
So, OK so there were witnesses there. Then it…
…OK Fadil was there as a witness.
‘Uh’ that my wife wants to make a report.
OK ‘ya’ so, so ‘ya’ I’m not asking why you think your wife wants the Faa to lodge report.
OK
OK. What I want to ask is, if what you did with Faa is not wrong. Why do you think Faa will still lodge report?
OK ‘uh’
Because there’s nothing to report if it is consensual.
…
My wife was the one who insist to make the report.
OK my questions is OK, you says that your wife insisted Faa to lodge a Police report. Is that what you are trying to say?
Correct.
OK and to you the sexual act was consensual?
‘Mm’ ‘uh’
OK what happened I think is consensual because I was drunk.
OK. Do you know what Faa told your wife?
I don’t know.
Then why do you think that it’s your wife that insisted Faa to lodge a Police report?
OK my wife in front of me, insisted Faa should make a Police report.
OK. So…
So, so what do you think Faa has told the Police?
‘Uh’
I don’t know.
OK so what we are telling you now is that Faa told the Police that the acts…the fingering were not consensual.
OK
OK
OK that is why I said that she could just left me and…
…because it happened just ‘uh’ beside her house.
OK.
She could have just left.
But
Or she could have shouted.
Or pushed me or just walk back to her house.
OK these are the things that she could have done.
OK but if she never do all these.
It doesn’t mean that you never assaulted her.
OK.
‘Mm’.
OK in short, even though she did not say no.
OK
…
Does not mean that she consented.
OK…
…because we had watched the video then we were aroused. And then I asked her ‘uh’…
…I asked her for a kiss.
Then she allowed me to kiss her.
OK.
OK so you are saying that your…so you keep, in your defence ‘uh’ you keep saying that your wife is the one that pressure her to lodge a report.
‘Uh’ is my wife said that in front of me.
OK are you saying that your wife asked Faa to lie to the Police?
‘Uh’
I don’t know.
Because when I apologise, when I was bowing down.
She told Faa just to make a report.
OK ‘uh’ are you willing to go for polygraph examination?
‘Uh’
What is polygraph?
OK it’s a lie or true detector test.
OK
Can.
Do you want your embassy to be informed of this?
OK.
Do you wish your embassy to be informed?
‘Uh’ just now outside also embassy.
…
OK.
So which one?
OK it’s actually the same. OK…
…it’s a process where any foreigner that were brought into a Police custody. In the lockup just now we asked you whether do you wish your embassy to be informed.
OK
So likewise for this interview…
…will be the same.
Just to take it to formality.
‘Uh’
Is it necessary for me to do it?
It’s up to you, it’s optional for you whether you want.
It…it is your right for your embassy to be informed.
OK…
But it is not compulsory. It is up to you.
It’s up to you.
…
‘Uh’ if you can advise me which is best.
It’s…
OK some people wants their embassy to be informed.
OK
And we will help to inform.
OK but there are some people who doesn’t want.
So ‘uh’ it is up to you whether you want or not.
The Police cannot tell you what to do.
OK
If you wish for the embassy to step in then we will help to inform.
OK
If not, if you want to choose to inform at the later date, you also can do so.
‘Oh’ later.
So you decide later, right?
OK I will decide later.
I think about it.
Because I’m not sure about this.
OK ‘uh’ do you have anything else you want to add before we conclude this video recording?
I just want to say I want to apologise…
…to all…
…involved.
Maybe it was my fault for following my desire.
And because of my drinking then I was angry.
‘Uh’
Because of my family, my…
…I want to apologise to Faa’s family.
I hope ‘uh’ I would be forgiven.
I would not forget.

So… and then… that’s why you did not go with them ‘la’.
‘Mm’ cause I said I was meeting a friend ‘ya’.
OK. So at that point of incident, OK, so you, I understand that you have been speaking with Jessica a lot with regards to her personal issues. Do you…
During that time ‘ya’.
…this, this was all communicated via what mode? Like verbal, text message or?
That point of incident or what?
‘Uh’ no, I’m talking about like in day to, you mentioned that you spoke to… Jessica with regards to her issue with her partner. Then she also shared with you about her personal sexual acts…
‘Ya’, that’s all verbal.
…this are all verbal.
‘Ya’, face to face.
OK.
‘Ya’.
So do you use any mode of, I mean any other mode of communication to communicate with ‘uh’ Jessica?
Sexual messages?
‘Uh’ be it sexual messages or daily messages.
No, no. ‘Uh’ ‘ah’ normal way, ‘ya’ normal like ‘uhm’ ‘uh’ have you cooked, have you ‘uhm’ ‘uhm’… are you going to  take the kids, what time you taking the kids from MRT station, this kind of stuff. ‘Uhm’… what else ‘uh’… the recent one ‘uh’ or she’ll, she will ask for money. ‘Uhm’…‘uh’ because ‘uh’… because she had to pay her, her sister-in-law. ‘Uh’… so ‘uhm’… we gave, my wife gave her a lump sum ‘uh’… 2 months pay in… March I think.
So April she didn’t have money, so she ask whether I can lend her ‘uh’ money then I will deduct from her pay ‘uh’ the following month. Then ‘uh’ so I, I transferred money to her account. ‘Uhm’… she asked for like ‘uh’ top up of ‘uh’ ‘uhm’… ‘uh’ data. So I topped up and her data for her. So this are the conversations we have.
So this were all communicated via…
WhatsApp ‘ya’.
…via WhatsApp.
‘Ya’.
And are all this messages, communication between you and her available in your phone?
‘Uh’… no. Only the recent one only. Where ‘ah’ then the recent one was the ‘uh’… ‘uhm’ I, I actually con, I ‘uh’, ‘uh’, ‘uh’ shouted at her over the phone.
‘Oh’.
‘Uhm’… ‘uh’… reason because ‘uh’… my mum was with me ‘uh’ you know when I was driving and she was ‘uh’ trying to call her to ‘uh’ give her some instructions to cook the food. ‘Uh’… so she didn’t answer after like so many times my mum called. So my daughter was at home and so I called my daughter and asked where is she? So ‘uhm’… she said ‘uhm’ she was on the phone in the, in the video chat, chatting with ‘uhm’… this new chat group that she has ‘uh’, ‘uh’, get in, gotten involve with.
‘Mm’.
‘Uhm’… so I was a bit upset ‘uh’… about this. So I called her. Told my daughter to ask her to call me. Then she called, I say I asked her what is she doing? ‘Uh’ she said she was on the phone. I said why are you on the phone at this time? Aren’t you suppose to be working? ‘Uhm’… ‘uh’… what was written in the contract between my wife and her. ‘Uh’ of course when the contract ‘uhm’, ‘uh’… ‘uh’ my, my wife told her that ‘uhm’… she was not supposed to use the phone.
OK, ‘uhm’… this, if I trace back this incident that ‘uh’ much earlier when she, she join our family, ‘uh’ she actually cried to my wife saying that she needed her phone. ‘Uh’ but the agency said ‘uh’ we, we can hold on to her phone and can only give, we can give it to her ‘uh’ at, in, during the evening. ‘Uh’ when she can talk to her, her family or her partner. So, she has been asking for the phone during the ‘uhm’… other hours of the day and then so my wife said no, you can’t do that.
‘Uh’ so my wife said we will s… put you on a probation for ‘uh’ 1 month and see how it goes. ‘Uhm’… then that was when my wife drew a contract with her ‘uh’… and she signed and she said OK, sh, she will not use the phone during the day and is only ‘uhm’ ‘uh’ at, at, at ‘uh’ the eve, the evening part. So ‘uhm’… so ‘uhm’… this, this is a bit sticky for her because whenever it comes to phone, she…is very possessive. ‘Uhm’… she will want to call and, and you know ‘uh’ want to have the phone with her at all the time.
So I was a bit upset at that time, so I said why are you ‘uh’, ‘uh’ having the phone? I’m going to take the phone away from you. ‘Uhm’… and because you’re not following the contract. So this was all I communicated with my, my wife as well. ‘Uh’… so the recent, the recent ‘uh’… text message I have is where she then she replied back to me in text saying that ‘uhm’ her mother passed away. ‘Uhm’… ‘uhm’ and, and that’s why she was talking to her friends. ‘Uhm’…
…so when I went back home, I of course ‘uh’ showed ‘uh’ concern and asked her what happen. Why suddenly your mum passed away. OK, then she said ‘uh’… her mum met with an accident. So I asked you know, do you need any help ‘uh’ do we need to do anything. Do you need to fly back? This kind of stuff. ‘Uh’… so after that I went into the room, then my daughter was there and then my daughter said that the day before she had actually told her that her Aunty passed away.
And not her mother. So that, that brought me to be a bit suspicious and I text my wife and I ‘uh’ said you know, she’s saying this kind of things. ‘Uh’…
So… can I just understand that how would you describe your relation, ‘uh’ not say your relationship, your family per se, your wife and yourself with Jessica and what is her working attitude?
‘Uhm’… my wife and I was very close. ‘Uh’…
As in your relationship with Jessica? That means your wife and yourself relationship with Jessica.
We are close with her.
You are close with her.
‘Ya’, we’re close with her. Is just that we have certain conditions ‘uh’… we don’t want her to be using the phone and, and during, during when she’s working time you see ‘ya’. So sometimes she has a tendency to just leave it on and, and I’ve seen her recording you know. You go into Facebook ‘uh’ just recording ‘uh’… her cutting the vegetables or doing something. And then my mum walking in the background. So I didn’t like that as well. ‘Ya’.
So how is her working attitude?
‘Uhm’… I mean she’s OK. She follows instructions but is just that sh… she needs, she needs this phone with her at all the time ‘la’. So whenever you know she, we want to take away, she gets very upset you know. And, and, and to a point that like as I said can be revengeful as well. ‘Uhm’… ‘uhm’… bluff us that ‘uh’ her mother passed away. OK. ‘Uh’… so that we will not grab her phone and keep it you see.
OK. ‘Uh’ I don’t have any other things.
OK, to clarify with my colleague’s questions.
‘Ya’.
You mention you loan her a amount. How much did you loan her?
‘Uh’… 120 if I’m not wrong.
120.
‘Ya’ it was, it was in different, different ‘uh’, ‘uh’… days.
OK, so in total how much have you loan her?
120.
So total 120.
‘Ya’.
Your wife is aware about this?
‘Uh’… no, I didn’t tell my wife about this. Because we, we, she did share that ‘uhm’, ‘uhm’… ‘uhm’ my wife will not ‘uh’ agree to it because she has given her 2 months pay in advance and she’ll be very upset if ‘uh’… she ask her for money. ‘Uhm’… I did tell my wife ‘eh’ why don’t we give her some ‘uh’ a bit of next month’s half pay in ‘uh’ April so that you know she can ‘uh’, ‘uh’ then other half maybe in, in, in May. Something like that.
‘Uh’… then my wife said she will talk to her about this. But that never happen ‘la’. So I just gave her the money.
OK, earlier you were sharing with us with regards to the one incident…
‘Ya’.
…where you had ‘uh’ lick her vagina and ‘uh’ pointed out the G spot…
‘Ya’.
…‘uh’ to Jessica. With regards to this, does your wife know about or asked you about this before?
‘Uh’… OK so ‘uh’, ‘uh’ no.
No.
Your wife is not aware?
‘Uh’ this one, ‘uh’ because ‘uhm’… yesterday when my wife was talking to her, ‘uhm’… ‘uh’ she told her that I send her sexual text messages. So I took, I, I denied to my wife, I said I didn’t ‘uh’ send her any sexual text messages. ‘Uhm’… ‘uhm’… so this part I did not, I have not told my wife.
OK, meaning to say that Jessica never bring up about this incident to anybody?
Which incident?
To your knowledge.
Which incident?
The licking her vagina and…
No.
…she had never brought up to anybody.
Never, no, no one.
OK.
‘Ya’.
So yesterday according to you ‘uh’… Jessica told your wife that you have been sending her…
Sexual text…
…sexual text messages.
…‘ya’.
So how did this, why would she suddenly tell  .
‘Ya’, I, I that’s why I don’t know, that’s why she would ‘uh’ say ‘uh’ I would have send her sexual text messages.
OK.
‘Uh’… the so, of course there was a second incident where I shared with you, I said I did ‘uhm’ asked her you know ‘uhm’… ‘uh’ which was a few weeks back. I said ‘eh’ do you want to ‘uh’… ‘ah’ no, ‘uh’ what, what I want to say ‘tsk’. I said ‘uhm’… ‘uh’… you, you, you want, you want to experience you know the licking again. I asked her. So she said, no. Then I stopped, I didn’t ask her after that already.
OK.
I said ‘uhm’, I’m, I’m sorry.
So what you’re suggesting that she could be referring to this ‘la’. The sexual text messages or harassment in that sense.
‘Uh’…
Is that why you’re telling us this?
Is not a harassment. No, I, I didn’t send her any sexual text messages.
OK.
‘Uhm’… I didn’t harass her.
OK.
‘Uhm’… I asked her if you know, she want to experience ‘uh’   again I didn’t, I didn’t force any…
…anything to her.
OK.
So when she said no, I stopped.
OK. So according to you, do you think is appropriate that ‘uh’ you get into such sexual acts of licking her vagina or asking her if you are to lick her vagina again ‘uh’ in your position as her employer?
Can I don’t answer that?
‘Uh’… do you understand my question? Do you think…
I understand…
…do you think is appropriate? So you don’t want to answer what you even think about it. Is it? Like we say this video recorded interview is to ensure what you say is properly documented…
‘Ya’.
…be truthful and…
‘Ya’.
…you know ‘uh’…
‘Ya’, because I already shared with you everything already.
‘Ya’.
‘Uh’…
So we just want to know, do you feel is appropriate? Or do you think is appropriate?
‘Ya’, that’s why I said is ‘uh’…
You don’t want to answer that.
…I don’t think is ‘uh’ appropriate for me to answer that because I already shared what the incident have been done.
OK, so you can tell that you don’t think you feel is appropriate to answer my question but you cannot answer if is appropriate to what you did earlier or what you did with Jessica.
I’m confuse ‘ah’, I, I don’t understand what you’re saying.
OK, so to clarify, you’re now telling me…
‘Uh’ ‘huh’.
…that you don’t feel…
‘Uh’ ‘huh’.
…that is appropriate for you to share with us or your thoughts on whether is appropriate with regards to what you did with Jessica.
‘Ya’, I know it is wrong.
OK.
‘Ya’ it’s wrong.
So, ‘orh’ you’re now saying you know is wrong.
I know is wrong but what I’m saying is ‘uhm’… at that point of time when we were talking, ‘uh’ one thing led to another. As, as adults we were communicating.
OK.
So ‘uh’…
There, there are reasons behind it ‘la’.
…there are reason so it wasn’t any force acts on me on her. ‘Uhm’… both of us were well aware that what was happening.
‘Mm’.
‘Uhm’… ‘uhm’… she consented to, to ‘uh’ allowing ‘uh’, ‘uh’ me to show her where the G spot was, ‘ya’.
Did you force her?
No.
OK. Because I never mention anything about force ‘la’. You, you voluntarily mention…
No, I just…
…about force.
…just highlighting that I didn’t force…
OK.
…her. Because…
You just want to make it clear to us ‘la’.
…make it clear, yes. I want to make it clear.
OK.
Because it was like casual co, ‘uh’ conversation with her that ‘uh’ went into intimate details about her partner and ‘uh’, ‘uh’, ‘uh’ and, and, and what they were doing.
OK, I understand. OK moving on, my next question, was there an incident where you held a knife and wanted to hurt yourself in front of Jessica?
‘Uhm’… yes.
Tell us more about it.
The reason being ‘uh’… ‘uh’ that was the incident I, I brought up. I said ‘uh’ when I asked her whether ‘uh’… want to experience licking again and she said no. And ‘uh’… immediately I apologise to her. I said I have a terrible tongue, I shouldn’t even be thinking this things. ‘Uh’… and that’s when I said I wanted to cut my tongue and ‘uh’… I wanted to hurt myself with the knife for even thinking of all this, this things to her.
OK. So to put the timeframe into context.
‘Ya’.
Immediately you ask her about whether she wants you to lick again.
Yes.
She said no.
‘Ya’.
Immediately you took the knife…
‘Uh’ no, not immediately.
…OK. So what, what is the…
The, the… ‘uh’ so when I ‘uhm’… ‘uh’ when she said no…
OK.
…then I, I, I de, then I apologised.
OK.
I said ‘ya’, ‘uh’ I shouldn’t even be asking you this.
OK.
So there was a bit of conversation first.
Right.
And then ‘uhm’… ‘uhm’… ‘uh’ then I, then I went to the, the knife. So there was a bit of conversation…
‘Mm’.
…going on ‘uh’ telling that ‘uh’ I ‘ya’, you’re right. I shouldn’t be doing this. ‘Uh’ then I took the knife, this was for my own ‘uhm’…‘uhm’… action it was not to threaten.
‘Mm’.
‘Uh’… so I wanted to hurt myself and then I just put there and said, ‘uh’… I really hate myself you know for bringing this, talking ‘uh’ to you about this. Now, I, I feel like ‘uh’ cutting myself.
‘Mm’.
Or, or cutting my tongue you know.
‘Mm’.
Cause saying a lot of bad things.
‘Mm’.
‘Ya’, that’s about it.
OK. So…
There’s no intent to ‘uh’… frighten her or to ‘uh’ instigate her in any way. It was just my own thoughts, my own ‘uhm’… ‘uhm’… feeling that I was having with myself.
‘Mm’.
‘Ya’.
OK, so where did this conversation with her initially took place?
‘Uh’ in the kitchen ‘ah’. The, the that area there.
The… asking her whether…
In the kitchen.
…also in the kitchen.
‘Ya’.
Then you took the knife also from the kitchen?
‘Ya’, because it was just…
Just beside.
…table, beside only ‘ya’.
OK.
‘Ya’.
So you mentioned that you, you yourself feel that you shouldn’t say such things…
‘Ya’, correct.
…or ‘ya’. So why, why would you say that? Because initially, ‘uh’… you said that or you shared with us you feel that is consensual you know. So why would you ‘uh’ express that you feel that is a very wrong thing, to the extent that you want to hurt and cut yourself. Maybe you can…
‘Uhm’…
…shed some light on this.
Can you repeat again?
Initially…
‘Ya’.
…when we are asking you whether is appropriate…
‘Ya’.
…not appropriate, is that the right thing…
‘Ya’.
…so you said…
…consent…
…‘uh’ although you know that it’s wrong but you feel that it’s consent… it’s between consenting adults.
‘Ya’.
So why when you ask her again, you will feel that it’s something very wrong to the extent that you had to cut yourself or hurt yourself?
No, I didn’t cut myself.
‘Uh’ or why did you…
I wanted to…
…‘ya’, you wanted to…
‘Ya’.
To the extent that you need to take the knife…
‘Ah’…
…to show…
No, the thing was ‘uhm’ ‘uhm’ because the first time when we did it, I already apologised to her and I said “No, it’s not going to happen again.”
‘Mm’.
OK, we shouldn’t be doing it.
‘Mm’.
It’s not right.
‘Mm’.
‘Uhm’ so we…
How did she respond to that?
Which one? No, this is my own thoughts.
Did you tell her?
‘Orh’ at that time, no. I didn’t tell her. So I…
OK, OK.
…I apologised to her when I asked her again.
OK.
The second time I…
How, how did she respond to you?
Nothing. She was just doing her own cutting.
‘Mm’.
‘Ya’, she didn’t say anything. So I just apologised to her ‘uh’ shouldn’t have asked her that and then I, I just on my own I just went and take a knife. Not even to, to frighten her, anything. I just brought it to myself and I, I ‘uh’ I was angry with myself and just I wanted to cut my, my hand and ‘uh’ say why am I doing this, you know? ‘Uhm’ shouldn’t be, you know, shouldn’t be thinking of all these thoughts.
OK.
‘Ya’.
So you feel it is very wrong…
Then…
…of you to ask again ‘la’?
Shouldn’t be doing, ‘ya’.
OK. So did you hurt yourself? Did you cut yourself?
‘Uh’ no, no, I didn’t. I didn’t. I, I was just very…
So you just like that and then put it back ‘la’?
‘Ya’, I was just angry with myself, then I just put it back. And then I just went, went to my room.
Did she try to stop you or anything?
No, nothing. So…
So you take a knife, she just look at you ‘ah’?
No, she was doing her own work, cutting.
OK.
‘Ya’.
OK. So can I say she was unaffected?
‘Ya’, can.
OK.
‘Ya’.
Have you ever requested to have sex or any form of sexual intimacy with Jessica?
Again? Again?
Have you ever requested to have sex or sexual intercourse or any kind of…
No.
Other form of sexual intimacy with Jessica beside what you earlier…
No.
…revealed to us? So these are only 2 occasion?
That’s all.
One, you actually did it.
‘Ya’.
One, she agreed, you actually did it. The second occasion, ‘uh’ you asked her if she wants you to lick again, she says she doesn’t want.
‘Ya’.
And you took the knife?
‘Ya’.
OK. There are 2…
There’s only 2…
So far…
…I can recall, ‘ya’.
Can, can you describe to me what knife did you take…
Normal…
to…
…vegetable cutting knife like... It’s just a normal…
Do you recognise which knife is it?
‘Uh’ a normal knife like this…
‘Mm’.
…to cut the vegetables.
OK.
With a black handle, I think.
Is it… is there like a lot of the same knife inside your house?
Actually I don’t know ‘leh’, I just went in, I just saw 1 knife and then I took. I also don’t know how many knives.
You, you cannot remember which knife is it that you took?
I don’t know.
So if, if I were to ask you to des… ‘uh’ point to me the knife, you may not know which one is it also?
‘Ya’, because I think there were too many knives and my, my, my attention was not there. I was just upset on why, why I was behaving like that.
Do you know how long or… it is, or you also never take note?
How long ‘ah’? It was a short knife ‘la’. ‘Ya’, it wasn’t a long knife. It was a short one. Cut, for cutting vegetables if I’m not wrong. Fruits, fruit knife.
OK, I’m done.
OK, there is information received that in, in March 2022, you had threatened to hurt yourself.
20…?
March 2022.
March?
So it’s last month.
Last month.
‘Ya’.
You had threatened to hurt yourself…
Now is 8 of April.
‘Ya’, OK.
‘Uh’ I repeat myself. There is information received that in March 2022, you had threatened to hurt yourself with a knife and forced her to have sexual intimacy with you. What do you have to say?
No. I ‘uh’ totally re… ‘uh’ re… what? Reject about the statement. I don’t agree. Disagree with the statement.
OK. There’s information received…
‘Mm’.
…that leading to this threat of hurting yourself, you had then licked her vagina…
‘Oh’.
…and inserted your finger into her vagina without consent. What do you have to say?
I totally disagree with that.
If the allegations are untrue, why will they be made against you?
I’ve no idea. As I said earlier, it was a act of revenge on her. ‘Uhm’ ‘uh’ she was upset that I was angry with her. ‘Uh’ I stopped talking to her because she was ‘uh’ always using the phone. ‘Uhm’ and I said that I would take her phone away. ‘Uhm’ so she was upset with that ‘uh’ and I kept asking her and probing her with ‘uh’ was it her mother who passed away? To get her to confess and tell us that she has lied. I was told her mother, was actually her aunt that passed away. So I think to cover up this whole thing she has…
OK, we will take a temporary break. We will take a document from our colleague.
OK, sorry, you can carry on.
‘Uh’…
So you say… we were asking you if the allegation are untrue, why were they be made against you.
‘Ya’, so I said it was act of revenge. ‘Uh’ anger on her part that her phone be taken away. As I’ve shared earlier, ‘uhm’ there were many instances where ‘uh’ first one, she cried to my wife ‘uh’ when she wanted her phone and my wife said no. ‘Uhm’ so she has this ‘uhm’ ‘uhm’ ‘uhm’ bond, bond with this phone that she has ‘la’, I mean. So if you ‘ah’ do anything with her phone or you take away anything, she will be very upset.
OK.
‘Ya’.
So you’re saying it’s because you all took away her phone ‘la’?
Took away her phone and then the, the, the allegation that I was trying to find out whether it was her mother who passed away or whether it was her, her aunt that passed away because we strongly believe her… it was her aunt that passed away and not her mother because we ‘uh’, myself, my wife, we kept… or I kept, I kept insisting, you know, show us the video, ‘uhm’ the funeral taking place, you know. ‘Uhm’ ‘uhm’ but she refused to, so I said “Show us your father. You know, can you talk to your father? Can you talk to your sister? Now, why are you talking to this guy, you know, your cousin?”
No, that… she refused to do that ‘la’, all that. So I, I believed that, because of that, she comes and cook up a story that I have ‘uh’ assaulted and sexually, ‘uh’ sexually assaulted her. ‘Ya’.
Was there an incident ‘uh’ where Jessica complained about you touching her inappropriately?
‘Uhm’ OK. She was sharing her, her ‘uhm’ what was that… Instagram videos with me. ‘Uhm’ ‘uh’ at my old house, ‘uhm’ my… 65. ‘Uh’ my mum was there. ‘Uhm’ and then I ‘uh’ tapped her lightly on her leg, OK? I… and, and, and ‘uh’ went off. OK, when she was sharing. So I just tapped her and then I said “OK”, I just walked off, OK? But ‘uhm’ she conf… confronted my… ‘uh’ no, told my wife that I actually ‘uhm’ ‘uhm’ move, move my hands up…
Maybe you can show higher up because ‘uh’ we’re not sure the camera…
‘Ya’.
…‘Ya’, you can stand, you do.
So she’s, she… so we were sitting down.
‘Mm’ ‘hm’.
We were actually sitting down. So I was with… I was ‘uh’ beside her.
OK.
So she was showing me her Instagram videos…
OK.
…that she took.
OK.
So I, I tap and then… I tap and then I walk away.
OK.
OK? But from what she told my wife is, I did slide up her, her, her, her this part…
OK.
…above her knee.
OK.
OK, I…
OK.
…my hand came up and then I, I touched her.
OK, take a seat. So this is what she told you wife?
She told my wife that, yes, correct.
What your wife ‘uh’ do about it?
So she confronted me. My wife confronted me.
OK.
I told her that I didn’t ‘uh’ slide ‘uh’ ‘uhm’ my hands…
‘Mm’.
…you know, my hands on her leg.
‘Mm’.
‘Uh’ I tapped and I  … walked away.
That’s all, right?
You know, you standing up.
‘Mm’.
You tapped and then you just walked on.
‘Mm’.
It was that, ‘ya’.
OK. When did this happen? In your old house ‘la’?
This happened ‘uh’ in my old house, ‘ya’, 65.
So meaning to say it’s before this ‘uh’ licking incident?
‘Ya’, correct, correct.
OK. ‘Uhm’ coming to your wife, ‘uhm’ maybe you can share with us ‘uhm’ are you all still sexually intimate?
We are.
OK, ‘uh’ how, how… what is the ‘uhm’… how often?
‘Oh’, do I need to answer that?
‘Uh’ we want to find out, like I say, ‘uh’ it can help us understand better with regards to the case.
‘Uhm’…
You can choose not to also if you want.
OK.
If you want to keep it, OK, if you don’t want…
I mean with… I…
But according to you, is you all are still sexually intimate ‘la’?
Yes, we are, ‘ya’.
OK. I’m going to show you a picture.
‘Mm’ ‘hm’.
Do you recognise this picture?
I don’t know whether this is the knife or the one below.
OK.
So there are 2. So I don’t know which one I took, honestly.
So it could be either ‘la’?
‘Ya’, could be either.
So it could be either of the knife. OK so…
‘Ya’.
…the accused ‘uh’ Mr Ravindran, was shown a picture ‘uhm’ consisting of 2 knives and he had ‘uh’ indicated that it could be either one of this knife.
‘Ya’.
OK. OK, can you sign your name?
‘Mm’ ‘hm’.
Sign, state your name and NRIC number and today’s date.
OK, do you mind writing ‘uh’ today’s date? Today is the 8th of April 2022. Do you have anything else to ask  …
‘Ah’ yes. Moving onto earlier on the question that was asked to you with regards to whether were there any other incident that Jessica alleged that you have touched her inappropriately.
‘Mm’.
So you mentioned that at the point of time there was once whereby ‘uh’ Jessica was showing you ‘uh’ IG video, Instagram video, right?
‘Ah’ ‘ya’.
‘Ah’ you tapped on her lap once.
‘Ya’.
And then you just walked away?
I walked away, yes, correct.
OK, so I just want to understand what is the video about and why would you need to tap on her lap once and walk away?
‘Uhm’ I mean the   of what I did I said “‘Ya’ OK I’m leaving already. Don’t need to show me anymore.” ‘Ya’, in that sense, right? You know, I want, I want to go out and do my work. You know, so I, I put my hand on her, on her ‘uh’ lap. Then I said “‘Ya’, ‘uh’, ‘uh’, ‘uh’ I’m leaving.” Then that’s all.
‘Oh’ so it’s like ‘uh’ signalling her…
Signal that I’m leaving, ‘ya’.
…that you’re leaving. ‘Orh’ OK, OK. ‘Uhm’ hang on ‘ah’. OK. So I… at this point of time, I don’t have anything else to ask already.

Yes.
She sat behind and we had a good conversation with each other and get along well with each other.
Yes, Sir.
During the conversation, I found her to be nice, honest and have seen not to be materialistic as she did not look at money. Towards the end, we exchanged contact numbers, I remember I had dropped her at her house in Tampines. I think it was before 2:00 pm. Since then we communicated through WhatsApp and spoke on the phone. We got to know each other better. From our conversation, I found out that she is single now and does not have boyfriend.
Yes, Sir.
She also told me that she has a mother and no father as her father had divorced from her mother. She has 2 brothers and she is the youngest. I also shared that I only had my father as my mother left long time ago. My brother has passed away while my sisters are married. I am the youngest that was when we realised that…
…we had a lot in common. I found her attractive as she is honest, straight, very truth and don’t put mask…
…on her face. The next day, I fetched her again at 6:00 pm at Toa Payoh, where I had fetched her the day before. I was supposed to send her home and she needs to reach home by 6:45 pm. This time round, she sat in front of the car with me. Along the way we spoke to each other as we got to know more of each other. We also hold each other’s hand while on the way to send her back.
Yes, Sir.
We reached Tampines earlier at about 6:00 pm before 6:45 pm. I then asked if we could spend the time longer. She then told me that she has to be back by 6:45 pm. At that time, she was still holding my hand. I then drove to the multi-storey carpark beside her block. And, as we wanted to spend more time together.
She did not object to it.
Yes, Sir.
I drove to the 3rd level of the multi storey carpark, I parked at 1 of the lots. There, I asked her if she was OK if her boyfriend was a taxi driver. I also did ask her if she was OK to be my girlfriend. She said OK. So then, I said that we are now boyfriend and girlfriend.
She didn’t object.
She did not object?
Yes, Sir.
So she said OK or she did not object?
I think she didn’t object. She never say OK. She say very alright, why, why, why, why about the job…
She, she did not object?

From her reaction, she was aroused. I shortly then put my hands lower and to the top of her panty and grab the clitoris…
Yes, Sir.
…to make her aroused even more.

At that time, we were both in arousal mode.
Yes, Sir.
I stopped because I realised it was close to 6:45 pm. She
then told me that, she, she had a bit pain. I understand that she has pains on her vagina area. I was surprised that she complain pain as I did not put my finger inside her vagina.
Yes.
I then told her that next time, I will be more gentle.

I admit that I will be more gentle to play, with her clitoris. After that I sent her home. There was no complaints from her.
‘Ya’. ‘Ah’ before she left right, she kissed me before she left.
OK.
And then, when she reached home right I asked her are you safely home, she said ‘ya’.
‘Ya’, let me finish the statement?
‘Oh’ yes, yes.
OK? After I sent her, I still messaged her. I asked her if she has reached home safely. She said yes. After that she did not messaged me. The last time I messaged her was this morning. After I realised that she did not reply, I cleaned my message with her as I thought that she might not want me anymore. Yesterday, I was sure that she did not say no to my advances to the kissing and touching her.
Yes.
I felt that we did not ‘uh’ we did that because we love each other.
Yes.
I feel like Winnie is a normal person and able to answer to me like a normal person.

What was the, what was the place?
‘Oh’ it’s a, it say 169 ‘eh’?

OK so around what time was that?
Around ‘uh’ ‘wa’ ‘wa’ I think it’s around 7 or 8 ‘ah’.
OK so what happened afterwards?
Then I, I went to pick her up. Then I, I OK she eventually
get into my car. And then we, I think if I’m not wrong, I started the conversation or she started the conversation. Basically, we just talk ‘ah’. You know when someone interested in you, she will keep talking and talking and talking. And then when you stop, she still keep talking one you can check the audio ‘ah’. So basically we, we, we talk almost a lot of things, a lot of things ‘ah’, then I also, from my side…
…I also trying to find a girlfriend. OK. This one frankly speaking one no need to hide one. So basically, I find her very honest, very attractive and then ‘wa’ good job, nurse you know. ‘Wa’ and then also ‘uh’ never look at materialistic.
She works as a nurse?
Not materialistic ‘ah’.
OK so you mentioned that she worked a good job as a nurse?
‘Ya’, ‘ya’, ‘ya’, ‘ya’.
How do you know that?
Because she say, she say ‘ah’ she work at ‘ah’ childcare ‘uh’ I don’t know what elderly care or childcare ‘la’ I’m not sure ‘ah’ she said she basically is a nurse ‘ah’.
Who, who, said she’s a nurse, is it you assumed or she tell you?
I think, the, the, the idea she talks to me is she’s a nurse ‘ah’.
OK. And then?
Basically, she take care of the elderly, she got explain ‘ah’ but then you know ‘la’ it’s all in the audio ‘la’.
OK then after that what happen?
Then, ‘uh’ we get to know each other more, we keep…
…interacting ‘ah’. ‘Ah’ take the vaccine. Ask her a bit, ask her ‘uh’ how she, she, how, she, sometimes I never ask, she also, say, say out herself ‘la’. Like her birthday when, she like to eat Mango cake all that, you know ‘la’ this one ‘ah’ sometimes is I ask, sometimes I never ask, it’s just get along well.
OK.
We just get, get along well, just then we just talk a lot, then a lot basically it’s all in audio. OK then ‘uh’ we, we get to know more…
…then after that ‘uh’ before alighting her right I think we exchanged number. If I’m not wrong ‘ah’, but basically she have my number and then she missed call me. And then I have her number and then we chat inside the WhatsApp. It’s all inside the handphone, OK. And then this is how we developed our…
Who asked, who asked for whose number?
If I’m not wrong, is maybe is I’m willing to give her my number and then she willing to jot down my number and then she willing to call me.
So, who initiated it?
It’s, maybe me?
OK?
Maybe her?
OK. Why?
But no rejection at all.
OK. Maybe you, maybe her, why do you think it’s you that initiated it? Why?
Because, ‘uh’ for a guy right, it’s not very good to let a girl initiate it and then for me, I’m those type, that I, I, I like to take the first step ‘ah’ because I’m a guy ‘ah’ and then I don’t like ‘uh’ what dilly dally one. Like means like, don’t like means don’t like. If ‘uh’ we cannot click together ‘ah’, no point ‘ah’ waste our time. This is what I am ‘ah’. I’m true.
So can you…
‘Ah’.

I, I already tell you because she’s true, she never wear the mask, she tell everything ‘uh’ she never ‘uh’ like ‘uh’ ‘tsk’ hold back, she never ‘uh’ tell, tell ‘uh’ lies or what, she just ‘oh’ frankly speaking, yes. This is what, this is what. I also tell her, this is what, this is what. It’s all in the audio. Sir, it’s a very ‘uh’ it’s a very strong point ‘ah’ a person is true ‘ah’ then it will last. If ‘ah’ it’s not true ‘ah’, after you married ‘ah’ a lot divorce one ‘eh’.
OK. So.
You see ‘ah’ Singapore so many divorce one ‘eh’. Because a lot of people wear the mask ‘eh’.
OK so that moving on…
‘Ah’.
…what happened after she alighted from the, from the taxi?
So we, we say goodbye from each other then…
Did you try to continue to communicate with Ms Winnie?
Yes, yes, we did.
How did you communicate and what was the commun… communication about?
I was like ‘uh’ ‘oh’ I’m only…I took the initiative I meet her so, it’s all in the message. I don’t remember. I know she did reply me some message.
What was the messages based on your memory?
Based on memory, ‘oh’ 1 message very touching. She say, don’t get distracted by me, please focus and concentrate on your driving. ‘Wa’, ‘wa’, so ‘wa’ so caring, so nice.
Do you think that’s a que that you shouldn’t ‘uh’ message her anymore? Do you take it as a que that you shouldn’t message her anymore?
I’m asking you a question.
‘Wa’, Sir. Do I feel ‘ah’?
‘Ah’.
I shouldn’t message her anymore. No, Sir. She never say.
‘Ya’, that means.
Focus on your driving and don’t message me anymore ‘ah’.
‘Ya’.
She never totally stop ‘ma’ she say ‘oh’  please don’t get distracted by me that means she want me to, she, she, she feel that she’s attractive and she attract me ‘ma’. Am I right to say that?
I mean it’s your own opinion ‘ah’ we have our own opinion.
OK but she, 1 think she never reject ‘ma’?
In your opinion she never reject you?
OK? In my opinion.
In your opinion, I’m asking you. In your opinion only right? OK.
In my opinion ‘ma’.
‘Ya’, so, so in your opinion, what do you think when she messaged you that way?
‘Oh’ I feel she’s caring, she’s ‘wa’ so concerned of my driving, she don’t want me to have any problem you know.
So what other things that ‘uh’ was in the message that night, I’m talking about the night on the 15th when you, when you just got to know her? Based on your memory.
‘Uh’ basically she is ‘uh’ she never really ‘uh’ ‘uh’ message because I think it’s family side also, because she got talk about her tradition   … quite everything want to ask mother one ‘ah’, so got one part in the audio right, you all can listen. I say ‘wa’ you 27 years old already still need to ask you mother ‘ah’ this thing.
Ask mother about what?
‘Oh’ because actually right I got suggest her, to celebrate her birthday because her birthday on Monday. I got suggest her that ‘uh’ can we celebrate on Sunday night. So it’s like we go out the we ‘uh’ watch movie, then we sing birthday cake, birthday song and then 12 o'clock you know midnight ‘ah’ just nice her birthday ‘ma’. I want to celebrate with her, so, she, she like I have to ask my mother first. Then, I say ‘oh’ OK. ‘Uh’ OK I wait for your update one ‘ah’.
How come you need to ask for your, your mother permission because you are already so old already 27 so it’s like I’m thinking how come like everything ask mother one ‘ah’ so I feel that she is a bit mother, mother side so too tradition already maybe her mother too tradition ‘ya’.
OK can. So, ‘uh’ did you also made a call to Ms Winnie that night?
‘Huh’?
On the 15th, when.
I did call her, I think I did call her, I did call her a few times,
you can check the, the, the record, but then I don’t know how  many times. And then I don’t know which call that she picked up and then she did not picked up but it’s all recorded it’s all inside the.
OK so.
Audio like, to my best knowledge is, I cannot remember.
So did you actually have phone conversation with Ms Winnie?
Sir, I really cannot remember but you can check the phone…
…as what of my best knowledge.
OK because I can check but then of course I want to know from you…
‘Ah’.
…based on the memory, did you ever talked or speak to Ms Winnie on the phone apart from the messages?
I…I really cannot remember but then definitely ‘ah’ anything right she never say no to me she never reject me.
OK.
OK.
So what happened the following day?
What happened the following OK, the following day is the same. All the message right I send her, you can check and then…
What was the messages about? Can you tell me?
‘Uh’ the messages were about I think I messaged her then, I, I say I want to come on the, I want to come ‘uh’ 6:00 pm to pick her up today.
Why, why 6:00 pm?
Because she told me that she finished work at 6:00 pm. I think previously we check ‘ah’ then she tell me that the work finish at 6:00 pm then she start work don’t know how many AM because  we too much message already. Too much you know, 2 days we get to know each other a lot of things. I can know her a lot of things, she can know a lot, I mean I also tell her my things ‘ah’. And the whether she can catch how many of my things, I don’t know…
…but then basically I did know that her working timing is morning think, 7 plus, 8 plus, 8:30 to 6:00 pm? I think like that…
What was she working, where was she working?
‘Huh’?
Where? Which company?
I don’t know. I think it’s a elderly care at this Block 169, Sir.
OK then after that, what happened?
After that ‘uh’ I tell her, I want to go and fetch her. She say ‘uh’ please don’t ‘ah’ what will you be ‘uh’ trouble you something like that ‘ah’. Read the message. I say it’s not trouble at the all. Then she never say ‘uh’ don’t come or she never reject me at all, don’t come, then I reach there OK, I think in between got calls if I'm not wrong ‘ah’.
Call?
‘Ya’, I think in between got call, you can, you can check.
So who call who?
If I’m not wrong, I called or she called. Because I, I got tell her remember to eat your dinner, ‘uh’ eat your lunch all that ‘la’ then I send her what I eat for my lunch, you know we share information ‘ya’ it’s all there, so basically and then before 6:00pm. 4…plus ‘ah’ I did send her a message ‘eh’ a another 1 hour plus ‘ah’ we going to her place, reaching your place and pick you up then she also ‘uh’ never reject. She never say no, she never reject.
What do you mean by she never say no can you explain to me further?
OK basically if… you see if I tell you I want to come ‘eh’ pick you up ‘ah’ we are meeting right, if like you are not interested in me or I’m not interested in each other ‘ah’, we will say ‘oh’  ‘uh’ please don’t come. Or rather, cut down, ‘ah’ I have a boyfriend or what or, or, or what, something like that, she never reject, so when I reach there right…
What’s her reply?
‘Huh’?
What was her reply then?
I cannot remember. If you can, you can check my phone.
Of course I will check your phone, but I’m asking you what was her reply?
Her reply ‘ah’…‘Uhm’ I not very sure because basically she never reject and then she, she, she even looking forward for my ‘uh’ like for my, for my, for my, for my, reaching.
OK how did you know she is looking forward?
OK because when the conversation during the, the ‘ah’ second day of the inside the car right she tell me she even lie to her mother that I’m one of the ITE friend right, ‘uh’ and come to pick her up, because she, she, she.
Did she say she lie to the mother? Or did she say she explained to the mother?
I not sure whether she lie or she explained but basically I’m not the ITE friend, I don’t know her before this.
How come this ITE come about?
Because she lie to her mother her own self, not I, not.
How come, how is this ITE came about?
How did this ITE come about? Because she feel that ‘oh’ she don’t know what to tell her mother when the guy ‘ah’ want to come and fetch her. This one is all inside the audio.
Did you ever share with her also that you were from ITE?
Yes, yes, yes, yes I did from, I tell her ‘ya’ I also come from ITE. From the ID, you can check my record.
OK but did you share with her that you were from ITE also?
Yes, I’m from ITE.
‘Uh’…when did you share with her is it on the first day or the second day?

‘Oh’ yes I also did come from ITE ‘la’.
So OK so how did this conversation come about the ITE?
‘Oh’ because.

I also don’t know, Sir. Too many information from 1 day, 2 day ‘ah’.

Basically, we, we, we catch the main point ‘ah’. ‘Ah’, after she process with the normal secondary school OK then go to ITE ‘ah’.
Which ITE?
I think is Simei or Central but definitely is these 2, either 1. Because it’s not Dover, I’m Dover.

Where did you picked her up? Can you tell me more?
‘Uh’ same, same place, ‘uh’ 169, Block 169 ‘uh’ Toa Payoh Lorong 1 if I’m not wrong. So, basically, I’m there I take the picture of where I am, and I send to her, ‘eh’ I’m here already. She say how come you come so early, I haven’t finish my work, I say never mind, ‘uh’ you take your time no hurry. Like that. ‘Ya’. Then she basically she say OK then she come them she own self come sit in front.
She’s how, OK you say she own self come and sit in front.
‘Hm’, ‘hm’.
Did she come and sit in front or did you invite her to sit in front?
No, I never invite, you can check the audio, video all that. I never invite. Basically, she, from my mirror, I see she walking from behind and then she want to she hesitate she want to open the door behind but I never   … because all my window is wind up and then the door is not locked. And then she come to in front, I think from this side, then she open or this side you can check the video. So she open the front door in front, and then she sit in front…
And then she sit in front then we have a good conversation then we developed from there.
OK so when you said good conversation, what did you guys talk about?
‘Oh’ ‘wa’ we talk about a lot of things ‘uh’ are you tired, today working all this ‘hor’ basically I concern for her then she also concern for me. Then we talk, Sir, a lot of things ‘ah’ you can check the audio ‘la’.

Yes, yes, yes, after that right, in between the journey right, we, we, we did hold hand…
…we did hold hand, you can check the, the audio part ‘ah’.
Of course I’ll check so how did the holding hand come about? Can you tell me?
Actually, I, I, I did ‘uh’ asked her to…

1 what sorry?
…I did say, “Do you mind ‘uh’ your boyfriend become ‘uh’ like a taxi driver”. Then she say she don’t mind. She’s OK with it. And then what, what, what’s wrong with a taxi driver. So basically, she never ‘uh’ stopped me from ‘uh’ ‘uh’ she never say no to me, OK and then it’s very mutual understanding that she, she want to develop this relationship because she never reject me in one way or another.
Reject you in terms of what?
In terms of ‘ah’ OK like I come and pick her or ‘uh’ I asked her do you mind if your boyfriend taxi driver…
…and then ask her ‘ah’ ‘uh’ do you mind ‘uh’ I put my hand like that then she hold my hand.
When was that?

It’s inside the car, during the journey.
OK inside the car, which part of the car, your hand? On the gearbox? Or?
‘Oh’ …

‘Uh huh’.
And then I like that. So she put her hand like that.
OK how come she put her hand there what actually happened?

Then after that I did also lower down my, my chair which I tell you also because I lower down the chair it’s all concurrently ‘ah’ she take out, she pull out her mask herself. And then, and then I lean forward. And then…
…she also lean forward, then she kiss me when I lower down my chair a bit, because I, I don’t want other people to see ‘ya’ you know, this kind of thing not very nice in public places. Then, after that I, I we aroused then I go forward…

Then she aroused, I also aroused.
How you know she’s aroused?
Because she never say no, if a girl ‘ah’, if a guy want to kiss

say, no ‘eh’ don’t touch me.
OK but did she say no to you?
No.
What, what’s her reaction?
She OK.
How you know she’s OK?
She, she kissed me back.
On the lips?
And, when I, when I want to, because I aroused and then when we are aroused we want to  you know the  ‘ah’?
French kissing.
OK. So, I asked for her tongue because I think she have no experience ‘ah’ basically before that I you can check the video right, the audio recording, she says she’s virgin. But then ‘ah’ I ‘wa’ 27 years old can be virgin ‘ah’ I also not very ‘uh’ trust her word but then after I find out ‘ah’ like ‘eh’ how come she don’t even know, really know how to kiss very well ‘ah’. Then I was like ‘uh’ asked her ‘ah’ give me your tongue. Then she never said no. She comply, she ‘uh’ give her tongue out…
…then we do French kissing.
OK.
‘Ya’, she never reject, it’s no force at all.
So while you’re doing French kissing, what happen to your hands and her hands?
‘Wa’, Sir you know ‘ah’ it’s all.
I don’t know so you must tell me.
Sir, I tell you she over me, I over her.
Over where?
OK, ‘wa’ Sir hard to remember ‘leh’.
You tell me, where, where was your hands?
My, my hand ‘ah’.
‘Ah’.
Not her hand, OK. My hand basically from here we slowly go down then slowly then we go in the shirt.
‘Hm’.
We, we go in, we touch then we.
We or you?
Me, me, me, me, me, Sir.
‘Ah’.
Sorry, sorry, me, me, me I touch.
‘Ah’.
Then she never push me away, she never say no, she never object to anything. She never say anything, she never, cannot, cannot, cannot. Why you doing this to me, never. Then, we continue kissing. Then I slowly I go down, then I kiss her, I kiss her. And then I.
Kiss her where?
I kiss her breast.
Which part of the breast?
‘Uh’ right ‘uh’ right side, her, her left side, her left side, my right side. Then after that I say I kiss another one. I continue kiss she never ‘ah’ throw me away she never say no. Then I started touching her. Go down and then go to the this part and then I start touching her. But I never thrust my finger go in.
OK.
But then this ‘ah’ I want to clarify ‘ah’ this part of my
finger ‘ah’ here ‘ah’ only like ‘uh’ maybe 2 mm or 1 mm ‘ah’. ‘Ah’ this part got a bit water. But then if I thrust inside ‘ah’ all the hand got water.
So.
But I never thrust inside.
So you say 1 mm, 2 ‘mm’ of this finger got water. Water where?
I also don’t know, because I, I touch, I play with her crevice.  This one I.
Crevice or clitoris?
I don’t know crevice or clitoris.
Or maybe what’s crevice?
OK ‘uh’ .
Sensitive area.
Sensitive area.
‘Ya’.
Is it inside the vagina?
No, no, no, no, no.
So where’s the location of this sensitive area?
It’s, basically it’s outside ‘ah’ never thrust in ‘ah’.
‘Oh’ you never thrust in but did you think you might have entered a little bit the vagina?
‘Hm’, because ‘ah’ Sir, this kind of thing ‘ah’ I also don’t know ‘eh’. Because ‘ah’ I really ‘ah’ now ‘ah’.
I’m asking you a question.
‘Ah’.
Answer my question.
OK.
So did you, did you, because you said your finger might have.
Because ‘ah’ this, this watery thing ‘ah’ I also don’t know come from what I frankly speaking ‘ah’ I don’t have a, a virgin girlfriend before. So this thing I also scared ‘eh’.
But you have sexual experience before?
Yes, yes, yes, yes Sir I did have but then not like that ‘la’. I, I, I if I you see ‘ah’. If a guy want to go in ‘ah’, means the whole hand go in ‘eh’.
OK.
But if I play with outside ‘ah’, and then I, I take, maybe I, I
touch a bit bottom ‘ah’, and then I never thrust in ‘ah’ it’s still considered penetrate or not.
OK.
Because I don’t know ‘ma’ Sir.
OK so I want to know, so apart from what ‘uh’ you did what was her re…
…reaction when she was   …
She, she never, she never pushed me away.
Do you feel any push from her?
No. She, she aroused.
How you know she’s aroused?
Because the sound audio is that ‘ma’ Sir.
What sound?
‘Wa’ Sir.
Audio is there, the sound.
What sound?
Meowing or something like that.
Meowing?
‘Hm’ ‘ah’ ‘hm’. Meow, meow ‘ah’ I.
What meow?
Can you do the sound?
‘Oh’ ‘ah’ Sir.
…
Meowing ‘ah’.
What’s meowing?
Like ‘ah’.
No, you no need tell us meowing or what, just tell us what was the sound?
Sound.
So basically, you know ‘ah’.
No can you tell us, can you just say, can you just use the sound, ‘ya’.
Like, like maybe got recording was recorded ‘ah’.
I know but you must tell me what’s the sound?
It’s like, a never say.
OK.
‘Ah’. Don’t, don’t, don’t do that to me, never push me away never. She never ‘ah’ ‘uh’ reject me.
Did she ever ask you to stop?
No.
Did she ever say no to you?
No. You can check the video. Audio.
OK. So after that, apart from meow ‘uh’ meowing what other thing did she do?
‘Ah’… we, we, we stopped.
No, she.
‘Ah’.
Apart from meowing, while you were kissing her breast, when you were touching her vagina.
She all over me ‘ah’.
When you say all over me means what? Her leg, where was her leg? Where was she sitting all that? You must tell me.
It’s all same ‘la’ Sir.
OK you must explain to me because I’m not there.
OK.
‘Ah’.
I tell you.
So that at least we can understand better.
She, she, she, she, she sit there and then her leg ‘uh’ is there, and then her hand over my shoulder or what then we kissing and then I touching basically is like that.
So was she also reciprocating.
Like that, like that, like that.
OK was she also reciprocating as you she was ‘uh’ reciprocating your kisses?
What is reciprocating?
Means you kiss her, she kiss you back.
Yes.
Which part of your body did she kiss you?
She kiss, she kiss my mouth, she did kiss my cheek. Then.
Was her tongue also inside your mouth?
Tongue inside my mouth. Yes we did have tongue, tongue.
‘Ya’ was her tongue inside your mouth?
I think so.
You think so?
Because I did suck a bit ‘ma’.
‘Hm’.
And then you know when, you need to suck a bit and then she.
Suck a bit of what?
Of her tongue ‘ah’. So if I suck a bit of the tongue, the tongue go in ‘ma’.
But was she the one who put the tongue inside your mouth or you suck the tongue that’s why the tongue inside your mouth?
Sir. OK basically ‘ah’ we explore ourselves ‘la’.
OK. What do you mean by explore yourselves?
I, I, I don’t know because I wasn’t there.
OK Sir basically we are, exploring ourselves. ‘Ya’, we are basically trying to find our, our intimacy and then we, she never reject me.
OK so I want to know, so did she, her tongue is inside your mouth is it because you suck her tongue or she put the.
I did suck her tongue I tell you already suck a bit you know.
‘Ya’ but did she, did she also put her tongue inside your mouth?
She did, she did.
She did it herself OK she did it herself or it’s because you use your mouth to suck her tongue.
‘Ah’.
…over to your mouth.
‘Ah’.
OK when, when, when there’s a mouth open ‘ah’ her tongue come out ‘ah’ then when my mouth open ‘ah’ my tongue come out ‘ah’ then we have French kiss a bit. Then when my tongue go in ‘ah’ her tongue come out in ‘ah’ so it’s who very who how to say who go in or.
So that’s why who were there ‘ma’ so you tell me ‘ah’.
Sir, don’t, don’t remember like that ‘leh’.
I’m a ask, I’m asking you a question. Sorry, I mean in your opinion. ‘Ah’.
In my opinion, she never, if, if she don’t like she will keep back her tongue ‘ma’? She will say ‘eh’ no we, we should not do that. Never. She willing to put her tongue inside my mouth ‘ma’?
OK so was there, was there any pushing from her, any?
No, no, no, no, definitely no.
OK. So you say you were playing with her clitoris, ‘uh’ just above the vagina and she was wet. So why did you stop?
OK, Sir. Because ‘ah’ ‘uh’ OK for my point of view ‘ah’ I feel that is not at the right time at the right place…
‘Hm’.
…to actually go further like ‘uh’ have sex or what ‘ah’. And then also because ‘uh’ I feel that ‘uh’ we have to ‘uh’ know each other further maybe after this ‘uh’ birthday and after she promise she make my birthday cake for me, you know sometimes it’s like feelings one, mutual understanding, mutual feelings, mutual ‘uh’ how to say ‘ah’ this kind of thing ‘ah’ you cannot force each other one and then also the timing ‘ah’ 6:45 is there already.
OK.
So we, we ‘uh’ like I cannot break my promise.
So who stop, you stop or she stop?
I stop.
OK why?
She never say stop. I stop, I stop myself.
Why did you stop?
Then because ‘uh’ actually it’s not at the right time at the right place, if we continue to kiss each other it will be, it will be you know, maybe baby also come out already ‘la’.
What you mean baby also come out?
You must tell me ‘la’, must be more specific.
Because she never, she never reject me and then ‘ah’ I continue and then she allowed she never reject OK? So basically, if we continue further ‘la’ it’s too aroused already, and then you know when we French kiss right, we are hardened and hardened and hardened right?
What hardened what?
Which part of the body hardened?
You must tell me because this is for the purpose of the person and…
Sir…
… ‘uh’ the penis erection.
‘Oh’ OK. So at the point of time, when you were, when you had intimacy with her…
Yes, Sir.
Was the seatbelt on or off?
I think she take off herself.
You think she take off herself?
‘Ya’. Her seatbelt is not on.
How sure are you?
Was her seatbelt on during the journey?
I think is on.
Then when was the seatbelt taken off?
I not sure. Because she own self take seatbelt in, take seatbelt off ‘ma’.
So you took off her seatbelt, you or her?
She.
How sure are you?
Very sure because I don’t take out her seatbelt ‘ma’. I don’t let her to take seatbelt, I don’t let her to put seatbelt ‘ma’.
So you sure you never take off her seatbelt?
I sure. Very sure.
When was the time that she take out her seatbelt?
I don’t know. I not very sure when.
You’re not very sure? Was it at the time when the conversation started or when the time she entered the multi-storey carpark?
‘Wa’ Sir this one I don’t know.
When did you let, so you said you’re not sure, but did you know, tell me ‘ah’, did you know, when did you…
… sorry. When did you realised that the seatbelt was off?
‘Oh’, when I, when I kiss her right, when I start to touch her right.
Which part of touch, because you said that ‘uh’ you lower down the chair first then during the kissing, so when was that, was it before or after you lower down your chair?
‘Wa’ basically I think we reach there we both take out our seatbelt already ‘ma’ Sir. This is normal ‘ma’, we reach the destination, we take out our seatbelt, she take out her seatbelt ‘ah’.
That’s why I ask you because I'm not there, so that’s why I'm asking you.
OK.
So, like I said before.
‘Hm’.
When did you realise that her seatbelt was off?
OK basically you know when a guy want to kiss the girl, when you want to go over her. You ‘eh’ if got something block, you will know ‘ma’? But then nothing block ‘ma’ the hand can move around, she can move around. So, it’s like, no, no, no obstruction ‘la’.
Sorry ‘ah’ let me clarify. So you realised that her seatbelt was off, OK because I don’t know ‘ah’ you say we know, we know, I don’t know OK. So you realised that it was off…
…when you lean over to kiss her.
OK.
Yes, or no?
Yes.
Yes ‘ah’? OK.
‘Ya’.
Can that’s all I want to know.
Thank you. Thanks for clarification.
So.
‘Hm’.
OK so, afterwards when you stop, what happen after that?
After that when I stop…What you mean?
After you stop, OK you said you stop ‘uh’ intimacy with her.
‘Hm’.
So what happen after that?
‘Oh’ basically I say now it’s time ‘ah’ 6:45. Then I say I
send you go back ‘ah’. Then she also never reject she also
OK ‘la’ then ‘uh’ but during that she say she a bit pain.
‘Hm’.
OK.
Can you tell me more about this?
OK ‘uh’ basically I think she is mentioning her vagina pain.
OK so when, when did she say she a bit pain?
After we stop ‘la’.
Stop then after that? Is it immediately, after you stop?
Not immediately ‘la’. Basically you know we, basically.
I don’t know, must tell me all that.
‘Uh’ maybe we after we stopped.
‘Hm’.
She got say ‘uh’ she pain. Then I say ‘oh’ OK ‘uh’ next time I gentle a bit ‘hor’.
So when she said she’s pain so ‘uh’ was she pointing to
anything or she just say it she’s pain?
I think she’s pointing her vagina pain because I don’t know she virgin ‘ma’? In the first place, I not very sure she really virgin or not ‘ma’.
OK so she was pointing.
Then how would I know.
OK she says she’s pain.
‘Ah’ ‘ah’.
Then according to you based on your memory, you remembered she’s pointing to her vagina area.
No, she never point. She just say, like casual talk ‘ah’ you know we.
I don’t know so you must tell me.
I tell you like casual talk ‘ah’.
OK.
She say ‘uh’ she a bit pain. ‘Ya’.
Did she elaborate that?
No, it’s all inside the recording.
I know it’s inside the recording, what you say is all inside audio but I want to know more from you.
OK ‘uh’ she basically say she a bit pain and then never elaborate from my knowing is ‘uh’ she feel that her vagina pain. And then from our last conversation is she say virgin, then I feel that ‘oh’ if she really pain ‘ah’ might, might be true because she’s not like because I never put my hand go in how come pain. I only touch the outside. If really pain ‘ah’, means maybe she really virgin ‘ah’.
What do you mean she really virgin? Why, why do you come to that conclusion, that if she virgin…
Because.
…outside also pain. You only put outside, means you only what you only.
‘Ya’, ‘ya’, ‘ya’.
You only ‘ya’, ‘ya’, ‘ya’ means what? You only what? Can you describe to me?
Only, I only touch her outside.
‘Uh huh’.
And then but, but then got water ‘leh’. Got a bit of water here ‘leh’ but then I never thrust in, if I thrust in ‘ah’ the whole hand got water. You can check my ‘uh’ hand DNA. No problem. So basically the water stuck here it’s just 1 mm or 2 mm like that. So basically you know when you are aroused right and then she never reject right, she never say no, she never say push me away, so we, we, we continue play with her, her, her downstairs ‘lor’. Just play ‘lor’.
Downstairs means what?
‘Uh’ private.
Panty?
Her, her, her private part ‘lor’.
Private part which part?
So basically I tell you already ‘ah’ play on top the, the, the sensitive part.
‘Ah’.
And then I try to arouse her with the sensitive part. And then I, I remember properly I didn’t thrust in.
OK didn’t thrust OK you said OK.
‘Ya’, this is definitely true.
OK.
OK so you say she a bit pain then after that what happen?
‘Oh’ I say I will be gentle next time.
‘Hm’.
And then she never reject, she never say ‘oh’ you cannot do this to me, you cannot or what, she never.
It’s all inside the rec…recording. Then she, she just ‘uh’ keep quiet then I bring, bring her go down.
Then before she leave she kiss me. OK.
And then goodbye like that. Then I messaged her are you safely home. She say yes. And then I send her ‘oh’ I’m continue driving and then I will ‘ah’ message her later when I reach home. What when I reach home. It’s all inside the, of the recording.
So you, you said that you will continue to communicate with her.
Yes.
Are there, was there any reply to your messages?
Yes.
What was her reply?
Yes. Yes ‘hor’. I reached home safely yes ‘hor’.
‘Ya’ so what was the reply after that? Is there any other reply?
No. I think the mother take the phone and read already but then I’m, I, I, I, I thought because during the end of the conversation, I did say we are boyfriend and girlfriend since you never reject me, you accepting me ‘ah’.
Reject you in terms of what?
In terms, in terms, like when I say we are boyfriend girlfriend then we are still holding hand.
Was you still holding hands with her…
Yes, yes.
…when you reach the place?
Yes. It’s all holding hand all that. I use 1 hand driving.
After, after, after you knew you can check the video.
‘Huh’?
After you left the carpark…
Yes.
…were you and her still holding hands?
Yes, yes, yes. Definitely.
You sure.
Yes.
OK.
You check the video please.
OK then continue?
And then ‘uh’ it’s like I'm, I'm what I OK I don’t want to say my opinion ‘ah’ if you haven’t ask me to say my opinion.
What?
But from our mutual understanding ‘ah’, she, she is ready, for me to love her, and I’m ready to love her, since I haven’t married. And then I feel she’s very click with me ‘ah’.
Very what?
Very, so, we can get along well.
OK.
And then she never reject me. The one thing is the obstacle is her mother.
OK.
Her mother I think too traditional already. Nowadays.
How you know that?
Because she keeps saying she need to ask her mother, ask this.
Ask her mother about what?
About OK. She needs to ask her mother, ‘uh’ can we, can I go out with my friend, can I go and celebrate my birthday on which date, which date, what time, to what time. And then basically, anything ‘ah’ she will say her mother.
‘Hm’.
She will update me later. She will ask her mother, she will update me later. Basically everything is in the conversation is in the audio, you can check. So bas…basically I feel the obstacle is her mother ‘la’. I hope ‘ah’ after this incident, if she really love me, I really love her ‘ah’ can I go and find her and then I seek her mother approval. Like then we get together.
While this case is ongoing, you are not supposed to find her.
OK.
OK? OK I want to know so why did you think ‘uh’ so ‘uh’ she did not reply your message at all after she said yes.
Yes.
So no reply to the messages.
Yes. I think her mother take her phone already.
OK so.
‘Hm’.
‘Uh’...when ‘uh’ when was the last time you messaged her? When was the last time you messaged her?
The last time ‘ah’.
‘Ah’ the last time.
Yesterday morning ‘hor’.
Yesterday morning, around what time?
I think 7 plus.
What did you message her?
I messaged her ,“Good morning.” Because I, I, every morning I will message her ‘ah’.
Was this messages still in your phone?
Yes.
Which part? Because when we checked your phone yesterday, the messages were gone.
Because.
Can you explain to me?
OK yes, Sir. Because I, I went to throw it in my ‘uh’ dustbin because I feel that ‘uh’ how come today morning she never reply me.
Dustbin means what? Means you’ve deleted the messages?
Dustbin means I deleted my messages.
‘Ah’ why did you deleted the messages?
Because you know when a girl not interested in you right, she read your message, she will not reply.
OK.
So I feel that ‘uh’ maybe she’s not interested in me and you know but I still have feelings for her. OK so I never delete her from my ‘uh’ friend list. So, she’s still inside my handphone, inside. So, I'm still waiting for her to reply me.
About?
Already ‘ah’ her mother go and complain.
OK. Ben I want to know.
‘Ah’.
Because you say that ‘uh’… you think that the mother was the one who read the messages and then took her phone away and read the messages. Then, OK you tell me that she might not be interested in you anymore.
‘Ya’, so.
So which is which?
Sir, because you know ‘ah’.
I do not know, you must tell me.
OK Sir, you see ‘ah’ when you, when you, when you are a guy right, you know a girl interested in you ‘ah’, a girl will reply you, message you. Instead of read your message and then never reply. Even if she busy, she will say something. So when the next day right if you, you can be busy the whole day today, the next day you sure have at least 1 second or 2 second to reply me right. If she have no, no, reaction of my even greeting good morning or what ‘la’…
…that means she is not interested in me. Then we, we should not pursue this ‘ah’ ‘uh’ ‘ya’ this thing ‘la’. This is my guess. But then I also have another guess, is maybe her mother ‘uh’ is don’t want her to contact me anymore.
Or do you think she was upset about after what you did in
the carpark that’s why she stop replying to your messages?
No, I don’t think so because she never say no to my ‘uh’ forward.
Forward?
Whatever I, I, I try to forward, like I try to get, get, get to her right, she never reject. And then she also ‘uh’ take the initiative to be with me.
‘Ya’. If a girl not interested in you ‘ah’ Sir…
…if you say want to go and fetch her. Would, would she let you come to fetch her? Even tell lie to her mother, that I’m.
I mean she might be interest, might be interested in you, but she might not be interested to have any physical intimacy with you.
OK, OK if a girl, if a girl not interested in intimacy with us right, then in the first place when I ask her permission ‘uh’ hold hand, she will say no, it’s not appropriate. That means.
Alright, but she might not be interested in you putting your finger inside or near the vagina? How about that, what do you have to say?
OK if she say, if she not interested in me touching her right like what you say. She will say, say, can you don’t touch me or ‘uh’ I, I don’t like, why are you doing this to me.
OK so I want to ask you ‘ah’ referring to the 2 occurrence that…
‘Ah’.
…you got to know her ‘ah’.
Yes.
Was there any time ‘ah’ that she ever disagree with you or say no to your whatever opinion you have got say…
What about my opinion?
‘Ya’. Basically anything that you have to say.
No, no, no. You can check the audio video.
Was there any time she disagree with whatever, maybe, maybe not even about your relationship, maybe about just general things. Was there any time that she disagree with you or rather you know…
No, no.
…ever decline your advances and all that.
No, I, I don’t think she, she ever ‘ah’ say no or anything. But ‘uh’ she did ask ‘uh’ why, why I are you going ‘uh’ multi-storey carpark.
‘Hm’.
I say since we have time right, we, we chat ‘ah’ we stay here chat. Then she OK with me.
But is it she OK with me, this she just kept quiet?
She just kept quiet. She never ‘uh’ say no. But then she also never say ‘uh’ cannot ‘uh’ no I want to go home. Basically her, her reaction is ‘uh’ if cannot right, ‘uh’ no I want to go home now. I, ‘uh’ ‘uh’ go why, why, why, why we must come here. ‘Ah’ OK ‘ah’ chat ‘la’.
Did she OK ‘ah’ chat, chat or she…
No.
…kept quiet?
Never. Basically, she never reject, she.
‘Ya’ so what, I want to know her reaction when you go to the multi-storey carpark. What, what, what was her ‘uh’ reaction like?
She, because…
…we are holding hand you know.
OK.
If she, she don’t like ‘ah’ she will, no. I don’t want your hand now.
OK.
But basically.
So, what was, what’s she doing, I want to know. Was she just quiet. Was she ‘uh’…
You know sometimes, you don’t have to say some yes thing ‘ah’.
Yes.
In order to do something.
Correct, and sometimes you, don’t know how to say no also. So, which one, which one. That’s why.
Am I right to say that also? Correct or not?
‘Ya’ you are right ‘ah’, Sir.
‘Ah’ so now you tell me, that’s why I want to know what about.
But we are more on happy things ‘ah’ instead of no, then cry. If you are being bullied, would you cry or not?
OK no, not about me ‘ah’. This one different ‘ah’ OK?
‘Oh’ sorry ‘ah’ Sir, Sir. Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.
So I want to know OK so I want to know…
‘Ah’.

But was she just quiet all the way? Was she just quiet when, when you, after you told her that you and her wanted to chit-chat.
No, we, we chat, you can check the audio, we chat.
I know.
‘Ah’.
But when you on the way up and you say that ‘uh’ you are here just to chit-chat, what was her answer, was she just quiet or just you know.

I said, ‘ya’, but I’m asking you.
Because I scared later you say I say wrong ‘ma’.
I’m asking, I’m asking you.
Yes, Sir.
So what was, based on your best knowledge, based on your memory, what was, what was the reaction then?
OK her reaction is ‘uh’.
Because it’s not a norm right, to go to the carpark with a person?
‘Ya’, she, she, she, she OK because ‘uh’ when I say I want to get to, we get to know each other by, by, by ‘uh’ staying together a bit better ‘ah’. Then she say OK by 6:45, she…

So basically she does not said any, she did not say no when you, OK. When was this conversation taken, was it before you entered the carpark or after you entered the carpark, or about to enter the carpark?
‘Wa’, Sir. To my best knowledge ‘ah’ it’s somewhere there ‘la’.
Somewhere where?
At CTE and PIE or inside the carpark.

don’t know ‘ah’.
OK to the best of knowledge…
You, you, can check the camera.
You tell me, that roughly where did this conversation took place? About to enter the carpark, or about to be near the house?
I think about to be near the house ‘ah’ Sir.
About to be near.

OK.
‘Ya’, ‘ya’.
I just want to clarify again ‘ah’.
Yes, Ma'am.
So you, you said that you suggested to go carpark.

Yes.
OK, that’s why, you, you took it that she was OK to go correct?
‘Ya’. This is  "" …
Wait, wait, wait let me finish first ‘ah’.
‘Ah’.
Then even at the carpark, you all also chit-chat, you all continue to chit-chat.
Yes.
So you took it that she was OK to follow you to the carpark.
Yes.

She said ‘ya’ OK.
That, that is what I want to clarify, is it yes or is it no?
Yes, yes, yes.
OK that’s all I want to know.
To my understanding ‘ah’.
‘Ya’. From your understanding.

‘Ya’.
Because we want to know.
Because any point of time ‘ah’ she say no…
‘Hm’.
…she reject me I will tell you.
OK so.
OK that’s why at the point of time I was asking you, OK?
There’s another thing I want to clarify.
Yes, Ma'am.
OK for the purpose of this ‘uh’ entire investigation ‘ah’.
Yes, Ma'am.
Where was this Tampines…
…located at?
Ma'am.
You say at the carpark, what was the address?
Really don’t know ‘eh’, Sir. Really don’t know, because you know why or not?
But you took, you took her.
When, when she come out of my car ‘ah’…
‘Hm’.
…you can check the audio ‘uh’ I don’t even know where’s your house. Can you give me your address name because I cannot remember? So, I key in the GPS, reach there already ‘la’ you know, follow the GPS ‘la’.
So you.
Postal code or full address?
I think is ‘uh’ just address, not postal code.
But it’s somewhere in Tampines ‘la’?
‘Ya’ I think 300 plus, or 400 plus. I really don’t know.
Let’s say if I were to bring you there, will you be able to show me where?
Plus.
If you tell me, if you tell me where’s the place ‘ah’ I know ‘ah’ I recognise the place ‘ma’. The multi-storey carpark, the, the house downstairs below only beside her block only.
OK.
‘Ah’.
OK can so I want to know, OK.
‘Hm’, Sir. I.
Why do you think that there was this report against you?
I feel that Sir, her mother too tradition already, too protective already.
What actually happened that led to this report?
I think also because that her, her, her mother protective about her, her, her daughter like what you said right?
Like what I say what?
Yesterday, like what you say ‘uh’.
What did I say?
You feed, ‘uh’ ‘uh’ a daughter come up from young to old ‘ah’ will you marry me like give a guy snatch her from, from, him like that.
OK.
So, like maybe her mother don’t like but then.
Don’t like what? Don’t like what?
Don’t like ‘uh’ guy or rather taxi driver.
In your view, why, why do you think the mother lodge a report against?
Because maybe I never.
So you’re saying that likelihood is the mother who lodge the report.
‘Ya’, ‘ya’.
Right?
Yes, yes, yes.
So in your view, why did the mother lodge the report?
Because her mother maybe too protective about her, don’t want her to get ‘uh’ ‘uh’ hurt but I can tell you 1 thing. I really in love with her. If you want me to marry her, I can marry her, but you let me speak to her mother, no problem one.
I say you’re not supposed to communicate with the mother and the victim.
OK, can, Sir.
OK. So, ‘ya’ why do you think her mother ‘uh’ wanted to lodge this report against you, can you explain to me properly? Because you say right…
Because.
…the mother, you think that the mother is the one who initiate right?
Because ‘ah’, because I can feel she’s in love with me, Sir. The thing we talk, the thing we do…
OK.
…the thing we plan to do her birthday cake, is ‘uh’ she promised to make me my birthday cake, hand-made, I never had a hand-made birthday cake, Sir. From so young until now, I never, I very touched. If she really make it for me, I very touched.
But I’m asking you why do you think she lodged a report against you not because.
Because I feel she won’t lodge, lodge against me because she love me.
OK so why was this report, who lodge, so in your view is her mother lodge the report.
Yes.
Correct?
Yes.
So why do you think the mother lodge a report against you?
Why do I think? Because the mother don’t want me to get to her, get near her.
Do you think she shared with her mother what happened?
I think she shared with her mother what happened.
OK and then what happened maybe.
Because she, she will tell the truth everything, she won’t lie, she very good one, she’s the best girl that I’ve seen.
What do you mean by best girl you have seen?
Because you know when a person lie right…
‘Ya’.
…they will wear a mask. No.
She will, she will tell the truth.  This, this, this she will say everything the truth and then I lie this kind of girl.
OK.
Not materialistic.
Why do you think she will share this with her mother?
Because it’s normal, because.
What do you mean by normal?
Because what do I mean.
‘Ah’, ‘ah’.
Because her mother will ask.
Ask what?
Or maybe.
She went home on time right?
Or, or maybe her mother monitoring her. Because, because she did mentioned that ‘uh’ inside the car, the conversation ‘ah’ she did mentioned that ‘uh’ ‘uh’ she got tell her mother that I picked her up everything and she also tell her mother that I’m one of the previous ITE guy. So, basically, she tell her everything, so I, I know that ‘uh’ her mother will definitely ask her ‘uh’ what we do, where, where we go.
Everything. Definitely her mother will check on her.
OK.
But I not afraid.
OK.
Because she never reject me and then I can feel her love and then she willing to give, I willing to take, willing to give, she willing to take. Take. No objection.
OK, so Ben moving forward.
Yes, Sir.
Are you willing to commit that, to say that you did not sexually assault Winnie?

Is that all?  "" … OK we have come to the end of this ‘uh’ interview.
Thank you ‘ah’, Sir.
OK so that means with regards to the allegation of sexual assault of Ms. Winnie. OK so before I end, is there anything you have, you had to say?
Now I can say what, what?
Is there anything else you want to say, add on.
OK.
After what you tell me…
OK.
…is there anything else?
OK like, like I want to say ‘ah’…
‘Uh huh’.
…that I, I, I like you all know ‘la’ I already sit before here come out, then I want to turn over a new leaf.
‘Hm’.
I drive taxi. What, whatever I earn now is clean money…
OK.
Not dirty money.
OK.
Last time I earn dirty money, I don’t feel good.
‘Hm’.
Now I want to turn over a new leaf, I earn clean money.
But the thing is, my working timing for driving is too long. From morning, 7:00 am, sometimes, even 6, sometimes 5 plus. Because we have to drive early in order to earn a peak hour. So until at night 10:00 pm, Sir. So from this timing I work right, I have no time for me to go and really know a girlfriend, a true girlfriend ‘ah’ that I really want to know 1 sincere, not divorced, really don’t look at my money, don’t…
…I mean I don’t have a lot money ‘ah’, like not taking advantage of me like go eat ‘ah’ I pay only, like not you pay your one, I pay my one you know this kind of girl hard to find. So basically I also learn that through this right, it’s not appropriate action.
I, I will, I will stop it if I’m given this 2nd chance.
What do you mean by not appropriate action?
Which means that, I should not actually find a girlfriend inside a taxi ‘la’?
Why?
I should go proper channel like . Sorry, I don’t know English.
‘Uh’…those kind of agency that helps to find.
‘Ya’.
‘Ah’.
And then also because my father is old already, and then he also say he, he also urged me to faster settle down, come out with 1 baby ‘ah’ because you know, . And then he have the time.
The time he needs to, to ‘uh’…
He have the…
Offspring.
…the, while, while….
To carry on the line, ‘ya’.
…while his life or he’s here ‘ah’ he’s alive ‘ah’ he still can see my he, he spend some time with my son ‘la’.
OK.
Because both my elder sister they give birth is all girl.
OK.
So basically…I want to fulfil my father last wish also before he pass away…
…you know because my father ‘ah’ also a lot sick, illness ‘ah’ a lot of high blood.
‘Hm’.
Diabetes. So, basically, I’m, I, I can say I’m ready, but just that I haven’t…
…really find someone, when I really find Winnie that is really, she is pure, truthful, no lies, no wear mask, but her mother object to me. If I can give a 2nd chance ‘ah’, I will go and find her mother and then you know ‘ah’ I know, this will be it, because her mother definitely or marry first then can ‘uh’ together then can go steady, but you know if a lot of people go this traditional way right, why nowadays a lot people married first ‘ah’…
Like I say before.
…then divorce so many?
Like I said before ‘ah’ this is your opinion, OK each individual, each family has their opinion.
OK. Don’t say opinion. From.
What is right and what is wrong ‘ah’ is really based on individuality ‘la’.  OK?
Can.
So is there anything else you would like to state, talk about this allegation?
OK. This allegation basically ‘ah’ from the start until the end ‘ah’ Winnie did, did the initiate, initiative to meet me, she never reject me, she even looking forward to meet me, she even looking forward for me to come and fetch her, hold hands together, no rejection, no say no, touching she also never say ‘eh’ why you touch or she never even scream or cry, if by having mutual understanding and knowing that we are actually adult, mutual trust and understanding we want to get to know more and explore each other is wrong, I will never do it.
OK, can. Is that all?
Is that all?
Yes, Sir.
OK can.
That’s all I want to say.
Can. With that I shall end the interview.
Thank you, Sir.
